<h2>Allo! I’m Robin, a web designer, writer, cursed front-end developer, and satanic .woff enthusiast.</h2>

<h3>Newsletter</h3>
<p>Behold! My newsletter—sent infrequently—about new things that I’m working on. Every so often it contains notes about web design and publishing things that I’m interested in, too. It’s eclectic, a little odd, and won’t always be about web design or fonts. You have been warned.</p>
