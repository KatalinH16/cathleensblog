extract: 'Working in Tails to remain anonymous while I developed the site, however,
  meant that this would be trickier than the web development I’d done in the past.
  I didn’t have access to the latest browsers I was used to, and I didn’t dare test
  the mobile version of the site on my smartphone. I also had concern that my coding
  style might betray my identity: my code for this project used similar commenting
  and naming conversions as other code I’d written in the past. Trying to develop
  software without your personal coding style is like trying to write an essay using
  someone else’s voice. I was also concerned that the visual designs I was creating
  could be compared to my work in the past.'
