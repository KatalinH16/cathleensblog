extract: "“A common refrain in this new age of self-publishing is that there are too
  many books. The outflow of new material has been likened to all sorts of natural
  disasters spewing forth and flooding the land.”"

[Hugh Howey](http://www.hughhowey.com/the-glut-is-good/) on the self-publishing industry:

> For every high-cost producer out there getting squeezed by falling prices (which includes indies who have run up their living costs and/or operations costs), there are legions of people who have day jobs and enjoy writing in their spare time. There will always be avid readers out there who dream of writing their own stories. They don’t have New York skyscrapers to rent out. They don’t have assistants to pay. They didn’t quit their day jobs last year hoping their breakout sales will continue indefinitely. These are just the next generation of those who possess an active imagination, a dream, and the persistence to finish what they start.
