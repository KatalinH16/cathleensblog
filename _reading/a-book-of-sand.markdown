I'm in love with [this short story](http://www4.wittenberg.edu/academics/mathcomp/shelburne/Infinity/notes/BookOfSand.html) by Borges:

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he lowered his voice. &#8220;I acquired the book in a town out on the plain in exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible. Its owner did not know how to read. I suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest caste; nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow without contamination. He told me his book was called the Book of Sand, because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.‚Äù</p>

<p>The stranger asked me to find the first page.</p>

<p>I laid my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my thumb on the flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless. Every time I tried, a number of pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the book.</p>
