Working with the team at [Sasha Bruce](http://sashabruce.org/) I developed a website for their 40th anniversary benefit concert which celebrates the causes of this [prestigious charity](http://sashabruce.org/about/).

> Today Sasha Bruce Youthwork is one of the largest and most experienced providers of services to youth in Washington, DC. Our work helps young people find safe homes, achieve and maintain good health and mental health, create and strengthen supportive and stable families, explore opportunities in education and careers, and become tomorrow’s leaders.

For the development of the site the only point that’s worth mentioning is the dire need of responsive images. I had to make sure that large number of images wouldn’t hold up users on low-bandwidth connections, which led me to using [Picturefill](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) and the new image syntax to progressively load larger images when viewed on desktop screens.
