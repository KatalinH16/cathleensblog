extract: In May 2016 I packed my things and moved to San Francisco to work as a designer
  at [Gusto](https://gusto.com/). I also write for [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/) and [Adventures in Typography](http://robinrendle.com/adventures), a weekly newsletter about type.

bio: As lonely kids are often captivated by stories, I was mesmerised by the tales
  I found in books and the narratives I soaked up through novels, short stories, poems
  and plays. The dark arts that produced these narratives were always fascinating,
  too. In fact, reading, writing, designing, programming, all of these activities
  seemed to be inseparable from one another, so much so that I had no idea that there
  were separate, predefined roles for each kind of work. As a result today I feel
  uncomfortable describing what I do on a daily basis; calling myself a designer,
  web developer, typographer, or a writer just sounds icky to me.
