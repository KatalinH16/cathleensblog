intro: |-
  My name’s Robin and I’m a web designer from the UK. I work as a product designer at
  [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) and as a writer for the team at [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/).
bio: |-
  A short while back I started writing a newsletter called
  *Adventures in Typography*. For years I’ve struggled to keep afloat amid the rising number of typefaces released each year, and the design and development best practices that are constantly in flux. And so, *Adventures* is where I train myself to pay attention to small details in the community. You can [follow along here](http://tinyletter.com/robinrendle).
colophon: |-
  Everything is set in the peculiar and robotic [Output Sans](https://djr.com/output/) by David Jonathan Ross and all fonts are loaded with the [FontFace Observer](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#fout-class).

  This website was created with [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com). All assets are supercharged by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The front-end architecture is based on the [atomic Sass framework](https://github.com/robinrendle/atomic-framework) and all of the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com).
