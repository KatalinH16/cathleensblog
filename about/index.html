  I’m a freelance designer, web developer and a technical writer for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/robinrendle/). Around these parts I’ve been writing about my adventures in typography, web design and reading for a couple of years now.

  <p>Elsewhere I’ve been fortunate enough to write for publications such as Smashing Magazine, Typographica, Hi, and Fonts In Use.</p>

bio: |-
    I spent most of my early childhood growing up on a big patch of land in the tail end of [Devon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon). As lonely kids are often captivated by stories, I was mesmerised by the tales in books and the narratives I soaked up through television. The methods that reproduced them were fascinating, too. Reading, writing, designing, programming, all of these activities seemed to be inseparable from one another. As a result I feel uncomfortable today describing what I do on a daily basis; calling myself a web designer, developer, or a writer just sounds icky to me.
