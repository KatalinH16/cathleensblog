bio: |-
  I’m a product designer at [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) and a writer at [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/).

  A short while back, I started writing a series of articles called [Adventures in Typography](http://robinrendle.com/adventures), a weekly-ish newsletter. For years I’ve struggled to keep afloat amid the rising number of typefaces released each year, and the design and development best practices that are constantly in flux. And so, *Adventures* is where I train myself to pay attention to small details in the community.

  Everything is set in the peculiar and luscious [Gimlet Text and Display](https://djr.com/gimlet/) by David Jonathan Ross and all fonts are loaded with the [FontFace Observer](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#fout-class).

  This website was created with [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com). All assets are supercharged by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The front-end architecture is based on the [atomic Sass framework](https://github.com/robinrendle/atomic-framework) and all of the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com).
