intro: |-
  My name’s Robin and I’m a web designer from the UK. Now I live in the city of San Francisco where I work as a product designer at
  [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) where I’m currently learning about the intense design complications of payroll and the tax system in the U.S. I’m learning an awful lot about constraints in the design process, how teams should be structured and the relationship between everyone and the government.

  I also write, edit and publish things alongside the team at [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/). Although, most of my time is now spent on [the newsletter](http://css-tricks.com/newsletter) where we collect everything that happened in this little community over the course of any given week. If you’re interested in front-end development I’d recommned you sign up.
