bio: |-
    Originally from the UK, I now live in San Francisco and work at [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) as a product designer. For a while I’ve also been working remotely with the team at [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/) where we write and make demos and discuss the ever-changing nature of front-end development.

    My curiosity for design is mostly quenched through my newsletter, [Adventures in Typography](http://robinrendle.com/adventures). For years I’ve struggled to keep afloat amid the rising number of typefaces released each year, and the design and development best practices that are constantly in flux. And so, *Adventures* is where I train myself to pay attention to small details in the community.

    Everything is set in the peculiar and luscious [Gimlet Text and Display](https://djr.com/gimlet/) by David Jonathan Ross and all fonts are loaded with the [FontFace Observer](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#fout-class).

    This website was created with [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com). All assets are supercharged by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The front-end architecture is based on the [atomic Sass framework](https://github.com/robinrendle/atomic-framework) and all of the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com).
