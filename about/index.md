<p class="article-intro">Allo! I’m Robin, a writer and web designer from the UK. Now I live in San Francisco where I design things at [please dear god hire me]. My work is always in the weird gap between writing, web design, and publishing.</p>

Please direct all compliments to robinjrendle@gmail.com

## About this website

I’ve been working on this website since 2014 and I see it as a public office; notes spread out everywhere in every direction—and whoa! don’t move that—those books and papers over there are super important! Jeez! The idea is that you can stop by and see what I’m working on at any given moment. This helps me refine my work, learn about web design and typography, and hone my writing skills a bit. It’s also a record of where I was and who I was back in, say, 2018 when [everything was falling apart](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/potential-and-loss/).

Once every couple of years I try to publish A Big Thing over in [/essays](/essays). This encourages me to work on longer writing projects than I’m typically used to. They often take weeks, months, years of research and thinking and being lazy about them and planning them out and designing them and then just winging it all at the last second and hitting the big green publish button and hoping for the best. Some of them don’t really stand the test of time, some of them are pretty embarrassing, and some of them are the best things I’ve ever done. I’ll let you decide which is which.

Also! This website was built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and published via [Netlify](https://netlify.com). You can view all the code [over on GitHub](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com) if you want to take any inspiration for a website of your own.

This website doesn’t collect any information from you, there’s no cookies, cus I respect ya and don’t want to grift ya.

## Typesetting

[Fakir](https://www.underware.nl/fonts/fakir/preface) is for headings and [Hex Franklin](https://hex.xyz/HEX_Franklin/) is used for body copy and small headings.

Also, also! I tend to change the styles and typography of this website a lot, and sometimes multiple times a week. [Let a website be a worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/), etc.
