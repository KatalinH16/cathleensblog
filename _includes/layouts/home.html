      <p>I’m from the south-west of England, but now I live in cloudy San Francisco where I design things at <a href="https://sentry.io">Sentry</a> whilst I blog alongside the ever-so-lovely team at <a href=
'https://css-tricks.com/'>CSS-Tricks</a>. Here you’ll find an archive of everything I’ve published in the last five years and so I can only offer a word of warning; things certainly got a little weird at one point or another. Over in <a href='/notes'>/notes</a> I write
        about whatever’s going on in my head at the moment and <a href='/essays'>/essays</a> is where those notes get polished into something a bit more readable.</p>
      <p>Also! My current side project is a newsletter all about typefaces and fonts (and what those words mean). It’s for book nerds, typographers, neon light enthusiasts, and for people who have no interest in typography whatsoever. Each week I
        write about <a href="/adventures/ghost-town.html">a stroll through the city</a> and a letter that caught my eye, or <a href="/adventures/take-care-of-the-margins.html">a beautiful book</a>, or even <a href=
"/adventures/videogames-and-wiggletechtm%EF%B8%8F.html">a wiggly videogame</a>.</p>
