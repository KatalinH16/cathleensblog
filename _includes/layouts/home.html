        <p>My name’s Robin and I’m from the south-west of England, but now I live in cloudy San Francisco. From this tiny desk by the window I design things at <a href="https://sentry.io">Sentry</a> and write for <a href=
  'https://css-tricks.com/'>CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="lil-heading">Essays</h2>
        <p>Over the years I’ve published a number of book-shaped websites. Each usually takes me a few weeks of research, design, and development—the idea is to try and push the web in weird directions. (This is where I try too hard).</p>

        <h2 class="lil-heading">Adventures in Typography: Season 3</h2>
        <p>My current side project is a newsletter all about typefaces and fonts (and what those words mean). It’s for book nerds, typographers, neon light enthusiasts, and for people who have no interest in typography whatsoever. Each week I write about <a href="/adventures/ghost-town.html">a stroll through the city</a> and a letter that caught my eye, or <a href="/adventures/take-care-of-the-margins.html">a beautiful book</a>, or even <a href=
  "/adventures/videogames-and-wiggletechtm%EF%B8%8F.html">a wiggly videogame</a>.</p>

        <p>I also blog basically every thought that goes through my head. It’s sort of embarrassing and yet somehow also extremely punk rock and impressive. You can <a href="https://www.robinrendle.com/feed.xml">subscribe via RSS</a>. (This is where I don’t try hard enough).</p>
