      I’m Robin, a writer and web designer.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Originally from the south-west of England, now I live in cloudy San
      Francisco where I make websites and write things alongside the ever-so-lovely team at <a href='https://css-tricks.com/'>CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>
      <p>Here though you’ll find an archive of everything I’ve published in the last five years and so I can only offer a word of
      warning; things certainly got a little weird at one point or another. Over in <a href='/notes'>/notes</a> I blog about whatever’s going on in my head at the moment and <a href='/essays'>/essays</a> is where those notes get polished into something a bit more readable.</p>
    <p>Also! My current side project is a newsletter
      all about typefaces and fonts (and what those words mean). It’s for book
      nerds, typographers, neon light enthusiasts, and for people who have no interest in typography whatsoever. You can subscribe below for weekly-ish updates:
