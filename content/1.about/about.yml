    My name’s Robin and currently I’m interning as a designer and front-end developer with the cool guys at [Erskine design](http://erskinedesign.com/) in Nottingham. This is where I [work in public](http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7189), and try to wrap my head around the current state of publishing and the web.

    I think that personal websites like this should act as a workbench instead of a microphone and so all of the code, content and design material that I used to make this website is available to download from [Github](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com). In the spirit of working in public and to start things off, here’s the first of many documents to come that outline my thinking and design process; the [style guide](http://www.robinrendle.com/style-guide) of this very website.

    - Find me on twitter: [@robinrendle](http://www.twitter.com/robinrendle).
    - Take a look at my work on [Github](http://www.github.com/robinrendle).
    - Or feel free to contact me about a project by <a href="mailto:desk@robinrendle.com">email</a>.
