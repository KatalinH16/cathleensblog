    My name’s Robin and I’m a writer and designer from the <span><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></span>. Currently I’m interning as a designer and front-end developer with the cool guys at [Erskine design](http://erskinedesign.com/). In 2012 I graduated from the University of Reading with an <span><abbr title="Master of Arts">MA</abbr></span> in information design.

    

    ## About the site

    This is where I [work in public](http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7189), and try to wrap my head around the current state of publishing and the web. 

    A website like this should act as a workbench instead of a microphone. But like any good workbench that might be found in a backyard or hidden in some dusty corner of a garage, it needs to start somewhere even if those first moments are awkward and calamatious. So to begin, any tool will do the job, as with time comes the organisation and design of the process. Things get less strenous, the creases can be ironed out and all the materials that were once spread about carelessly soon find a home. I like to think of this process as a scientific method.

    At the moment I’m reading the novel by Italo Calvino entitled *If on a winter’s night a traveler*. This spectacular little book contains the genesis of what I hope to explore; the author investigates reading, writing and storytelling with freakish precision. The protoganist is infatuated with what he calls the Other Reader, another person that happens to be reading the same book at the same time as they stumble over a misprint in a novel they both own. When they discuss the story of this novel they become more aware of this forgotten participant in the love triangle between reader and writer (the other reader) and consequently learn more about the story than if they had read alone.

    This is a test, of sorts. All of the code, content and design material of this site is available to download from [Github](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com), and so you can tinker with it or explore how things work if you’re interested in how I think publishing on the web should work. I’ll also begin to post [notes](http://www.robinrendle.com/notes) here and there about my work. To kick things off, here’s the first of many documents to come that will outline my thinking and design process; the style guide and outline of structure, code and layout. As this site develops and grows so too will the style guide and, although this place is nothing special at the moment, it’s a wonderful place to begin.
