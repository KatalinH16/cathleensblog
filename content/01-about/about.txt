Title: About me
----
Text:
My name’s Robin and currently I’m a designer and front-end developer at [Erskine design](http://erskinedesign.com/) in Nottingham. This is where I [work in public](http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7189), and try to wrap my head around the current state of publishing and the web.

Sometimes I’ll write a small thing or two that’s [rough and messy](/notes), whilst building up to larger, [more complete thoughts](/essays). This is also where I’m learning how to do front-end web development right; from thinking in components, to testing design solutions and building good workflow habits etc., so things might be a little janky from time to time.
