Title: About me
----
Text:
My name’s Robin and currently I’m interning as a designer and front-end developer with the cool guys at [Erskine design](http://erskinedesign.com/) in Nottingham. This is where I [work in public](http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7189), and try to wrap my head around the current state of publishing and the web. Sometimes I’ll write a small thing or two that’s [rough and messy](/notes), whilst building up to larger, [more complete thoughts](/essays). This is also where I’m learning how to do front-end web development right; from thinking in components, to testing design solutions and building good workflow habits etc., so things might be a little janky from time to time.

I like to think that this sort of site should act as a workbench instead of a microphone and so all of the code, content and design material that I used to make this website is available to download from [Github](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com). In the spirit of working in public and to start things off, here’s the first of many documents to come that outline my thinking and design process; the [style guide](http://www.robinrendle.com/style-guide) of this very website.
