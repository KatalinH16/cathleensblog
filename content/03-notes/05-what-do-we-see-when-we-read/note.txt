[In this long and winding essay](http://jacketmechanical.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/picturing-books.html), the mesmerisingly brilliant Peter Mendelsund, [book design wunderkind](http://mendelsund.blogspot.co.uk/) and writer, discusses how we picture the characters of a novel as we read. Along the way he breaks down his reading of *To the Lighthouse* by Virginia Woolf:

<figure class="quote">
<blockquote><p>And she lost consciousness of outer things, and her name and her personality and her appearance, and whether Mr. Carmichael was there or not, her mind kept throwing up from its depths, scenes, and names, and sayings, and memories and ideas, like a fountain spurting over that glaring, hideously difficult white space…But this is one way of knowing people, she thought: to know the outline, not the detail.</p></blockquote><figcaption class="cite"><p>Virginia Woolf, <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/To-Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/B002ECEJ3G">To the Lighthouse</a></cite></p></figcaption></figure>

This sparks a stream of consciousness from Mendelsund, as he explores how we miss the little peculiarities of a character or a setting and, in some ways, steal things from the world we know whilst planting them into the fictitious work of a stranger:

<figure class="quote">
<blockquote>
  <p>Literary characters are physically vague — they have only a few features, and these features don’t matter. Or, these features only matter in that they help narrow a character’s meaning. But these features don’t help us picture a character. Characters are ciphers. And narratives are made richer by omission.
</p>
</blockquote>

He argues that the color of their eyes or the inflection of their accent are not the truly important aspects of a person in the grand scheme of things. What’s important in *To the Lighthouse* is who we empathise with, who becomes the villain, which characteristic traits develop or perhaps those which deflate over time. What’s certain to me at least is the semi-transparent aspect of a novel is one of its many irresistible charms.
