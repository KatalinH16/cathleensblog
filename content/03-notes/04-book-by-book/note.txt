[This peculiar article](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/03/im-just-a-working-class-guy-trying-to-take-part-in-the-conversation-that-all-the-smart-people-are-having-what-books-should-i-read/) caught my eye this week. A reader of the [Paris Review](http://www.theparisreview.org/) asks for advice about how to build their library and how to start reading the very best of literature; from all across the various classics over the centuries to the flood of modern authors, journalists and bloggers of today. But it was the demonstration of sheer thirst that stopped me in my tracks:

<figure class="quote"><blockquote><p>I’m desperate to start some kind of grand reading plan that will educate me about the world but don’t know where to start. The classics? Which ones? Modern stuff? Should I alternate one classic with one recent book? How much should I read fiction? How much should I read nonfiction?</p></blockquote></figure>

Ultimately these sorts of questions shape how we read, so adjusting to the discrepancies and absences as a library grows is all part of the fun. By thinking about the genres or topics that we’re reading or the variety of authors (their gender, their ethnicity, their prominence in history or culture) we measure not only the current health of our bookshelves today, but we also start mapping our future libraries and fine tuning their [voluminosity](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/washington-diarist/magazine/100979/library-books-paper-texts-voluminous) in the years to come.

The American writer and editor [John Sullivan](http://johnjeremiahsullivan.tumblr.com/) argues otherwise, however, as he believes that *the planning* comes secondary to *the reading*. In his reply to those questions he tries to put the reader’s mind at ease:

<figure class="quote"><blockquote><p>My only piece of advice before recommending some titles would be: don’t fall for the inferiority/superiority racket. We’re not on a ladder here. We’re on a web. Right now you’re experiencing a desire to become more aware of and sensitive to its other strands. That feeling you’re having is culture. Whatever feeds that, go with it.</p></blockquote></figure>

This had me thinking about those articles that examine books, such as reviews, and how they’re deceptively useful. Most of my own library for example originated from links that I stumbled on whilst browsing the footnotes of a great article, or Twitter, or Instapaper or [blog posts](http://retinart.net/books/for-the-designers-shelf-writing-lies-scripts-and-letters/). This revealing article in the Paris Review has inspired me to look back and answer some of my own questions about what we should read and when.

Over the years I’ve found that a number of books have frequently dipped in and out of conversations whilst others have managed to weave their way into my thoughts on a daily basis, almost involuntarily. I want to talk about those books here, those *books that linger* — permanent, sticky items. Now they might not contain terribly practical advice or easy-to-apply steps or rules about the topic but they tend to push their various genres into places that I had no idea existed. Best of all, each of them in turn are written by brilliantly smart writers. So here goes.

    <h2>The Humane Interface</h2>
    <h3>by Jef Raskin</h3>
</hgroup>

<figure class="quote"><blockquote><p>Instead of icons explaining, we have found that icons often require explanation. If you wanted to obscure or encode an idea to keep it from prying eyes, substituting icons for words might not be a bad start. The interface presents an icon, but the meaning of the icon is not visible&hellip;</p></blockquote></figure>

Focusing primarily on the psychological aspects of interface design and published all the way back in 2000, *The Humane Interface* is the best thing I’ve ever read about designing software. The author’s merging interests in design and philosophy captured my attention from the very beginning, as even when he disregards over zealous, romantic language in describing what an interface or a computer should hope to achieve, he appears to look for the underlying, philosophical roots of all this digital work.

From the use of icons and metaphors to habit forming commands and button gradients, Raskin expertly pinpoints the successes and failures of modern interfaces. Interestingly enough he also makes predictions in the book that are eerily close to the developments of recent years, but I’ll try not to spoil the book too much as I must have shouted *“fuck yeah!”* over a dozen times whilst reading it and so I leave the best bits to plunder for yourself, dear reader. For a Jef Raskin primer, head on over to this [wonderful and heartbreaking eulogy](http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/my-father-final-gift/) of his life before you begin.

    <h2>If on a Winter’s Night a Traveller</h2>
    <h3>by Italo Calvino</h3>
</hgroup>

<figure class="quote"><blockquote><p>On the wall facing my desk hangs a poster somebody game me. The dog Snoopy is sitting at a typewriter, and in the cartoon you read the sentence, “It was a dark and stormy night…”. Every time I sit down here and I read “It was a dark and stormy night…” and the impersonality of that <em>incipit</em> seems to open the passage from one world to the other, from the time and space of here and now to the time and space of the written word; I feel the thrill of a beginning that can be followed by multiple developments, inexhaustibly; I am convinced there is nothing better than a conventional opening, an attack from which you can expect everything and nothing; and I realise also that this mythomane dog will never succeed in adding to the first seven words another seven or another twelve without breaking the spell. The facility of the entrance into another world is an illusion: you start writing in a rush, anticipating the happiness of a future reading, and the void yawns on the white page.</p></blockquote></figure>

Published in 1971 by the brilliant Italian writer Italo Calvino, *If on a winter’s night a traveller* is a novel broken up into individual, loosely threaded tales about the missing chapters of a book. These tales weave their way in and out of the narrative whilst giving Calvino an excuse to joyfully describe his love of stories, books and most of all, the paradox that sits in the middle; he explores how reading can be both an act of isolation and connectivity simultaneously.

It’s a novel about storytelling, about words and characters and beginnings and where to connect things and where to stop them. It’s a story that’s told almost entirely in the second person and if I were to quote one section of the book I’d likely end up rewriting the entire thing, copying it all out word for word. To put it simply, the book is essential reading for anyone even mildly interested in telling stories.

    <h2>The Information</h2>
    <h3>by James Gleick</h3>
</hgroup>
<figure class="quote"><blockquote><p>The invention of writing had catalysed logic, by making it possible to reason about reasoning — to hold a train of thought up before the eyes for examination — and now, all these centuries later, logic was reanimated with the invention of machinery that could work upon symbols. In logic and mathematics, the highest forms of reasoning, everything seems to be coming together.</p></blockquote></figure>

Found in the stream of brilliance that is Mandy Brown’s [working library](www.aworkinglibrary.com), *The Information* is a history of data, machines and code. Gleick focuses on the innovative and spellbinding events of how communication has developed, but he also questions their knock on effects within human culture. Whilst *If on a winter’s night a traveller* focuses on the reading, this book primarily deals with all of the processes leading up to and surrounding it.

Yet, unlike the previous books mentioned here, *The Information* is much broader in scale and doesn’t solely examine a particular medium or format. The author dives head first into historical accounts and unsuccessful technologies and reveals so many useful insights for any designer, reader or general enthusiast to brain-munch on.

    <h2>Close to the Machine</h2>
    <h3>by Ellen Ullman</h3>
</hgroup>

So I haven’t read this novel on programming and computers yet but I feel the need to talk about it since *what I’ve read* appears to share so many similarities with *what I’ll read*. The novel is written by Ellen Ullman, who was a programmer before she became a novelist, now already peeking my curiosity. Although, it was this excellent review by the writer and developer [Paul Ford](http://www.twitter.com/ftrain) that’s pushed the book to the top of my to-read list. Here the writer describes how Ullman’s book encouraged him to think about the ties between human and computer languages:

<figure class="quote"><blockquote><p>Think of a book as a single string of data – a straight line of language from the opening sentence to the closing sentence, intended to create a reaction from its audience. This string made of words is punctuated with helpful symbols that have no innate meanings, but produce reactions in the reader (i.e. the period does not mean anything, but its pause can be meaningful in more ways than any word). The string is divided into arbitrary lengths called “pages”, which are in turn subdivided into “paragraphs” made up on “lines.” Creating one of these long strings is what we call “writing,” and making the book is “publishing,” except the two have been intertwined for centuries; the writer approximates the form of the book as she works, thinking in terms of arbitrary units - paragraphs, chapters, parts - which have only tenuous analogue in our day to day experience of spoken language.</p></blockquote><figcaption class="cite"><p>Paul Ford, <em><a href="http://www.ftrain.com/ullman_machine.html">Getting Close to the Machine</a></em></p></figcaption></figure>

*How on earth can I avoid this book now?* It seems that all of the books I’ve been reading lately have been swirling around this other book, caught in its gravitational field. Their common themes are tangled up in each other so strongly that, afterwards, I think a detour of some description might be necessary. Maybe something entirely different, like an unwieldy history of biology perhaps or a brief side step around the field of astronomy&hellip;
