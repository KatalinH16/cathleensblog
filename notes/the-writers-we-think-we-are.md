extract: George Saunders and how to avoid writing like anyone else.

Everyone shut up, Saunders is talking:

> In my early thirties I saw myself as a Hemingwayesque realist. My material: the time I'd spent working in the oil fields in Asia. I wrote story after story out of that material, and everything I wrote was minimal and strict and efficient and lifeless and humor-free, even though, in real life, I reflexively turned to humor at any difficult or important or awkward or beautiful moment.
>
> I had chosen what to write, but I couldn’t seem to make it live.
>
> One day, serving as a note taker on a conference call at the environmental engineering company where I was working, I started, out of boredom, writing these dark little Seussian poems. When I finished one, I'd draw a cartoon to go along with it. By the end of the call, I had around ten of these poem-and-cartoon pairs, and because they weren't my "real" writing, I almost threw them out as I left work that day. But something stopped me. I brought them home, dropped them on the table, went off to see the kids. And then I heard, from back at the table, the sound of genuine laughter, from my wife, as she read those stupid little poems.
>
> This was, I realized with a start, the first time in years that anyone had reacted to my writing with pleasure.

This is an extract from _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_, Saunders’s book about writing that I won’t stop talking about, and it perfectly captures how I think about my own somewhat-idle-somewhat-stalled-somewhat-_something_ writing career.

But hush! There’s more:

> To put it another way: having gone about as high up Hemingway Mountain as I could go, having realized that even at my best I could only ever hope to be an acolyte up there, resolving never again to commit the sin of being imitative, I stumbled back down into the valley and came upon a little shit-hill labeled “Saunders Mountain.”

Of course this is upsetting because that shit-hill is a glorious, beautiful shit-hill that formed the ever so perfect novel _Lincoln in the Bardo_. But sure, okay. I’ll play along here, George. Yes. You indeed do suck.

I guess I’m not sure which mountain I climbed up before I realized I could go no further and had to turn back. Oscar Wilde Mountain? George Orwell Rock Formation? My writing from just a few years ago is _excruciatingly_ dry, formal to a fault. It’s like a chap dressed up to the wrong party, wearing 13th century ballroom shoes to a skatepark. I was trying so damn hard to copy poor old Oscar and George back then—and it wasn’t until someone told me to stop writing manifestos that I bucked the trend.

Anyway, Saunders continues...

> This is a big moment for any artist (this moment of combined triumph and disappointment), when we have to decide whether to accept a work of art that we have to admit we weren’t in control of as we made it and of which we’re not entirely sure we approve. It is _less_, less than we wanted it to be, and yet it’s _more_, too—it’s small and a bit pathetic, judged against the work of the great masters, but there it is, all ours.
>
> What we have to do at that point, I think, is go over sheepishly but boldly, and stand on our shit-hill, and hope it will grow.

This is sort of how I see my writing contributions today; small, insignificantly tiny even, but mine.
