[Aegir’s website](https://aegir.org) is extremely, impossibly, fantastically good. He only updates it once a week or so but when he does it’s fantastic: each blog post is a custom-designed card like [Five Moons](https://aegir.org/words/five-moons) or [Four Quarter Moons](https://aegir.org/words/four-quarter-moons) or [The Yellow Season](https://aegir.org/words/the-yellow-season) or [Still Harvesting](https://aegir.org/words/still-harvesting). Each of them feels like what Robin was dreaming up with [his protocol](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/) and a comic-book-like, Tumblr-esque, indie-web thing.

If these little cards could be shared around and seen together, if these cards could be made together colaboratively, then I think that would be something really exciting, too.
