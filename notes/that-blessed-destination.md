extract: President Obama’s eulogy for John Lewis.

I’m sat in my kitchen listening to President Obama’s eulogy for John Lewis and absolutely not crying:

> We have to translate our passion and our causes into laws [...] like John we have to fight even harder for the most powerful tool we have which is the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act is one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. It’s why John crossed that bridge, spilled his blood. [...] If politicians want to honor John [...] let’s honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for. [...] Once we’ve passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, we should keep marching to make it even better by making sure every American is automatically registered to vote.
