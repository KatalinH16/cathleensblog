Elizabeth Lopatto wrote this great piece about [how junk web design practices are ruining the web](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618804/google-facebook-login-ads-web-design-hell); the login forms, the popups, the chatbots, the everything! Our standards are so very low when it comes to web design and Elizabeth points at it all and says _why_:

> One of the major problems with salesbros is that they think “always be closing” is a mantra to live by because they didn’t understand the point of Glengarry Glen Ross, which is that salespeople are nightmares. That’s why there’s always some silly pop-up chat at the bottom of every website now. No, Pamela — if that is your real name — I don’t want live assistance booking my yoga class. You are hogging valuable screen real estate.

The problem is that it’s real hard to argue against shitty design and product decisions. If [junk data](/notes/vibe-driven-development/) rules your organization then it’s almost useless fighting; when you see your customers as links in a spreadsheet or tiny dots in a graph then every terrible design decision under the sun can be justified. Heck, in most cases junk design isn’t permitted but _preferred_.

(If the numbers are the most important thing, then your website will suffer the consequences.)

Anyway, Elizabeth continues and reminds us that, away from the web, we can live a life without ads, without constant junk and distractions. In real life, “they” cannot have everything from us:

> ...there are no real public spaces on the internet. Here in reality, I can fuck off to a park and hug a tree and sit on a bench and do stuff without ads, without anyone trying to track me, and without having to pay a dime. There was a time within my memory when people tried to make websites feel like semipublic places — you could hang out on someone’s cool blog and enjoy yourself. Sure, there might be a banner ad, but that’s like paying a buck for coffee and then just sitting in a diner all day with free refills.

To be honest, I don’t know if I share this same optimism as scammers and con artists have always been a part of the web and always will be. Plus I don’t think it’s healthy to look back and claim that there was a golden age of the internet because it’ll encourage us to think of the open web as over and absolutely eff that.

(If you want to see a better web, you have to make it.)

Anyway, I still agree with almost everything in this piece and one of my favorite things about making a website is not including any of this junk that Elizabeth describes. No upsells, no whatevers. I like it when a website just…ends. I like it when I get an email about the thing I signed up for. I like it when the unsubscribe link works. I like it when a product stops existing after I stop using it and doesn’t try to consume my life with garbage.

The products I adore the most are the ones I want to return to because they respect me as a person, and clearly don’t see me as a point in the data.

That’s how I see this website, too. Over the years I hope this approach has let folks trust me a bit, knowing that I’ll never pilfer their information and I hope this has garnered my website with a small reputation; I’ll always respect your time and attention as the precious things they are.
