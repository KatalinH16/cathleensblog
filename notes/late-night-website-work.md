I made a bunch of fun updates to the site last night: fixed a lot of the default typography styles (they’re not good yet, please hold!), added a few colors, replaced a ton of tags in older blog posts, and sort of redesigned the homepage around that. Now when you head to the homepage you won’t see a list of notes but a bunch of categories, instead. I’m still working through how I want that to work but there’s a few old posts in there that I like, posts that have disappeared into the archive.

Also last night was well spent looking for a typeface: oh the joy of watching a bad movie in the background whilst my computer is chock full of test fonts and .pdf specimens and endless tabs upon tabs of letters!

Of the many miracles I discovered last night, Grilli Type’s [Free Trails](https://www.grillitype.com/free-trial-fonts) was among the best. They let you download their whole font catalogue and from there you can import them into your website, switching things out quickly and playfully. So after a few experiments and click-clacking fonts together I settled on [GT Alpina](https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-alpina), a buck wild serif that matches my writing somewhat well.

So what’s left for the site now? Well, I’ve still gotta polish a lot of things, fix the typography some more, redesign the homepage and think about how all these tags can act like little magazines or something.
