I don’t think I’ve ever linked to [Alphabettes](https://www.alphabettes.org/) before but this blog is thoroughly worth adding to yer RSS feed. I stumbled over the website again today doing some research for a little thing and forgot how joyous it is.

The Alphabettes gang describes their website like this:

> Alphabettes.org is a showcase for work, commentary, and research on lettering, typography, and type design. Our loose network is here to support and promote the work of all women in our fields. Currently (December 2021), Alphabettes has 250+ members from around the world in various areas and levels of activity.

Just check out [this fantastic post](https://www.alphabettes.org/abetki/) about Ukranian calligrapher-designers Victoria and Vitalina Lopukhina. They made these beautiful letters on the iPad running between bomb shelters:

Joyous! Joyous, I say!
