Was it three years or four? It feels like a decade since I was last here. But today, here I am. Here we are.

The UK.

We are sniffly and dry and exhausted. Neither of us slept on the plane and I made the mistake of watching Dead Poet’s Society and weeping for the last hour of the flight. God that film rules. If ever there is a thing you need to explain, like, my whole deal, then that’s it.

Delirious in London again. Excited to get to the hotel and fight my partner to the death for a warm shower and then for the coziest side of the bed.

We’re here for two weeks. First, a gallop around London for a few days and then down to Plymouth to see my family. After that?

Paris.
