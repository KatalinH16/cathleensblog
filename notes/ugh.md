Lately I’m feeling rather _ugh_. I know why; reading has lost its luster. I find myself uninterested in almost every book, every essay, every tweet. One morning I’ll get all excited and pick up a book that someone recommends and then—bah!—the text is joyless. It doesn’t have that peculiar _kick_ of newness to it and at that very moment my RSS wellspring runs dry, too.

Without a dazzling book the world suddenly feels quiet, empty. Lonely, even. And ugh I feel like I need high quality hypertext to simply be a functional person.

I _require_ that text do this unspoken playful, hopscotch thing and when I can’t find anything quite like what I’m looking for then I get all mopey. I mope to the coffee shop, I mope to the corner store, I mope around Target as we get small things for our apartment. Friends lose their razzle dazzle, too. What good am I to my friends without a !!!!-have-you-seen-this-book-yet kind of text message? No good to anyone.

I picked up _The Revenge of Geography_ yonks ago from a tiny library in Noe, which might I add—wow!—what a name for a book. I had missed the blurb at the bottom from Henry Kissinger though and just before I openes the book I saw his repulsive quote. What view of geography does this book have if Kissinger’s the main guy, the blurbist of honor? With absolutely no due respect whatsoever: fuck Henry Kissinger and everyone remotely close to him.

Ahem.

Next I picked up a book about Atari and the death of the video game industry but I felt like the guy was too rambly, too impressed by himself for me to enjoy any of it. (This reminds me that there’s a kind of charm when the writer is enjoying their own company, but it’s a very difficult thing to pull off without sounding like you’re smoking your own supply.)

After that I picked up _The Smallest Lights in the Universe_ by Sara Seager and I hoped it would snap me out of this boring malaise. I hoped it would be a memoir of sorts, like _H is for Hawk_ but switching out the hawk for Jupiter. But after half a dozen pages I find, again, this sort of self-impressed style of writing. It becomes cludgy and soup-thick, stew-like, even. I can’t describe it but when people talk about romantic relationships and subsequently describe themselves as a catch without a hint of irony then ughhhhh I am bored of you.

All these _ugh_ feelings likely have nothing to do with the books and everything to do with me. I’m not looking for a book when I pick these things up, I’m looking for An Event. I want to feel like I have to keep up with them as they drag me into the future. I want an entirely different vantage point from a tip of the world I’ve never seen before.

I suppose then that I’m not looking for good books, I’m perhaps looking for new friends.

Or something, I don’t know man. I just work here.
