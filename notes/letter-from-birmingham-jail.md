extract: A beautifully typeset version of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s letter.
---

On April 16th, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote a letter from jail, where he was imprisoned for marching against segregation, and Jason Pamental made [a rather lovely typeset version](https://letterfromjail.com). In fact, [Jason’s newsletter](https://rwt.io/newsletter) is a constant wellspring of lovely typeset things.

Rereading Dr King’s letter though it’s shocking that so much of it is still relevant today, 57 years later:

> ...I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial “outside agitator” idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider.
