Wrote this lil piece about the [:has selector](https://css-tricks.com/did-you-know-about-the-has-css-selector/):

> File this under stuff you donâ€™t need to know just yet, but I think the `:has` CSS selector is going to have a big impact on how we write CSS in the future. In fact, if it ever ships in browsers, I think it breaks my mental model for how CSS fundamentally works because it would be the first example of a parent selector...
