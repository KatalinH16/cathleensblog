After a rather unfortunate set of circumstances, which I’ll make sure to write about soon, I’m now available for contract web design and front-end development work.

From now until late May 2016 I want to work on as many projects as possible. So I’ve set up a [portfolio](http://robinrendle.com/work) and [written](http://robinrendle.com/work/about) a little bit about how I can contribute to both the design and development of a web project.
