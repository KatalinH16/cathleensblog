[Cool cool cool](http://www.annosphere.com/):

> The annosphere is a sundial that works without the sun. It shows you the time of day and the time of year as well. It keeps track of the changing seasons and models sunrise and sunset for each day, for any place on earth.
>
> The annosphere tells time, but more usefully, it presents time. It shows you sunrise and sunset, the start of spring and the winter solstice. It lets you see on your desk what you canâ€™t see in the world: the steady pace of time, the subtle day to day changes in sunlight and shadow, the cycles that run through each year.
