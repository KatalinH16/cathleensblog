Ya know something I’ve never played with before? SVG filters. Sure, I’ve taken a look at the tutorials and clicked around a few Pens here and there, but I’ve never fully invested in them as I didn’t ever see the point—I’m never going to work on big illustrationy stuff so eh, it’s just not for me. Thankfully however, Henry Desroches has shown just how wrong I am when he wrote this great piece the other day about [how to distort text with SVG filters](https://henry.codes/writing/how-to-distort-text-with-svg/).

This inspired me to experiment with them on my own site after stealing some of Henry’s code and I kind of like it! When you hover over the links on my homepage now, each of them will suddenly look as if they were printed with a blotchy, messed up stamp. Also I updated the main headings on /about, /notes, etc. to use the same stamp effect and I think it looks pretty neat.

I spent a little bit of time animating these SVG filters but it looks like it requires a lot of [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) magic to get working and eh, I kinda don’t want a ton of javascript just for this one off animation. It would be _really_ neat if I could animate these filter properties with custom CSS properties but after faffing about for 15 mins I bailed and went back to watching Bullet Train.

ANYWAY. Go read Henry’s post because it’s great and reminded me that I shouldn’t just slap a nice font on a website and be done with it. There’s so many design opportunities after a typeface has been chosen and I need to remind myself of that in the future.
