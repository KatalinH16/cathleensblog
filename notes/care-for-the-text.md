I wrote a lil thing about [why we should care about writing](https://css-tricks.com/care-for-the-text/), even as front-end developers and designers:

> How do you make a great website? Everyone has an answer at the ready: Flashy animations! The latest punk-rock CSS trick! Gradients! Illustrations! Colors to pack a punch! Vite! And, sure, all these things might make a website better. But no matter how fancy the application is or how dazzling the technology will ever be under the hood, a great website will always require great text.
