A while back I had the pleasure of joining [Charles Peters](https://twitter.com/charlespeters) and [Tom Carmony](https://twitter.com/tomcarmony) on [a special episode](https://viewsourc.es/2015/09/18/episode-13-typography/) of Viewsources all about typography and design. We talked about our favourite type systems, how to get started in the industry and how to make websites have great typography whilst still thinking about performance.

So considering this was the first podcast that I’ve ever been on I’m _very_ happy with how things turned out. My cough button worked gloriously and there were only a few instances where I _ummmmmed_ and _ughhhed_ my way through the conversation. Next time I’ll be sure to come prepared with a proper mic though.
