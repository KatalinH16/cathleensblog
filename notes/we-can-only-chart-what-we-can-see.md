  "“Is a word academic jargon? Is it the sort of thing you only see in a Pope
  or Blake poem? What about Doctor Who fanfic? Is this word a slur? Or is this word
  boring and everywhere, the Wonder Bread of words, remarkable only because it is
  wholly unremarkable?”"

Kory Stamper on the use of [the word “shithole”](https://korystamper.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/down-the-shithole-why-lexicographers-need-your-profanity/) by #45 and what it means for lexicographers:

> ...the American press has traditionally been loath to print unseemly language like cusswords in full, and this has been a problem for lexicographers on a number of levels. As we all know, dictionary entries need to be based on a word’s accumulated and sustained use in print. We don’t just use that body of accumulated use to come up with a word’s definition, which tends to be one of the easier things to describe, but also its status and its register. Status and register are fancy word-nerd ways of describing where exactly in the language a word sits, and how a word is deployed. Is a word academic jargon? Is it the sort of thing you only see in a Pope or Blake poem? What about Doctor Who fanfic? Is this word a slur? Or is this word boring and everywhere, the Wonder Bread of words, remarkable only because it is wholly unremarkable? If a word is used in a particular context, or with a particular sort of connotation, a lexicographer should tell you that by using those italicized labels that come before the entry: informal, formal, technical, academic, literary, vulgar, disparaging, obscene.
