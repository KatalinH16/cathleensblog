For the Sentry blog I wrote about some of my experiences at work, like learning how to gather consensus and [how to be political](https://sentry.design/blog/design-is-politics):

> When I first heard that you have to “sell” your designs many moons ago though I was horrified. Shouldn’t great design be obvious? Why do I have to sell it when the design work itself is hard enough? Shouldn’t beautiful work be celebrated and encouraged, not bartered and fought for? For years I would blame the person I was pitching my designs to for their lack of understanding, their lack of vision. How dare they not recognize my genius! The nerve!
