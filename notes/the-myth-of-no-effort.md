[This talk](https://youtu.be/SOfOlOQIcqw) by John Roderick is still outstanding. Dammit, ugh! I remember sitting in the audience that year and swooning the whole way through this thing (you can actually see me in the video sat next to two people I love and at one point in the recording I swear you can hear my goofy laugh, too).

John talks about “the myth of no effort”; for years he believed that talent should replace any hard work, and that he wanted to loaf about on his couch making songs without having to try. That’s something that I think I believed for a long time, too. And it’s something that [I still struggle with](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/on-writing) from time to time.

Anyway, this talk is like an excellent blog post; equal parts vulnerable and funny, as if John is typing things out loud in front of a live audience.
