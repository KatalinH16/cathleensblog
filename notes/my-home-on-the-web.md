My relationship with the internet is changing. I don’t really have a home on the web now, a place I can go to log-in, kick back, and doom scroll. That makes me happy for many reasons—yay for no abuse and casual violence!—but also sad for others—the loss of distant friendships! Oh, all the jokes I’ll miss!

Every community on the web that I’ve been a part of has ended up skyrocketing my anxiety eventually and no matter what community or platform that I try—Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc. etc.—it all ends up leading to the same place. Not feeling great. I fall down some rabbit hole or find some horrid group of folks and feel like the place just isn’t for me.

So I’m not sure if there’s a better home besides this one.

Even if it’s just me here.
