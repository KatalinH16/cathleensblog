I know I’m somewhat biased, but oh boy oh man howdy do I love this collection of [end of year thoughts](https://css-tricks.com/category/2021-end-of-year-thoughts/) over on CSS-Tricks. I especially love this note from Geoff when he argues to carefully [read your website](https://css-tricks.com/read-your-website/):

> If there’s only one thing you can do to make your website better, then you could do a heckuva lot worse than taking some time to read it. Seriously, do more than look at the words—read them and take in everything that’s being said from the top to the very bottom. And really get in there. I’m talking about opening up everything in the navigation, expanding accordions, opening modals, and taking it all in.
