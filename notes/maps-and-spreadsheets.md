extract: And how to work on a design systems project.
---

When it comes to design systems I don’t have many words of advice. I have _opinions_ and _intense anxiety_ but giving advice without context of the organization, the codebase, the people, is so very hard to do. But if there’s one word of advice that I keep learning, over and over again, and with almost every design systems project, is this: all design systems work should begin with a spreadsheet.

That’s because it naturally puts boundaries around the project, it defines this one small part of the hyperobject, and helps so you don’t fall down too many rabbit holes. Countless times I have found myself abandoning a project because I’ve bitten off more than I can chew. Instead of slowly tackling things as a checklist, I’ve jumped head first into the fray. And that almost always leads to disappointment of one kind of another. Eventually, without a trusty spreadsheet at my side, I find that I’ve broken too many tests and I can no longer see how much that I’ve changed. The project stalls, my enthusiasm wanes.

So when it comes to design systems, a spreadsheet is a map and guide, a breadcrumb trail through the bonkers state of things.
