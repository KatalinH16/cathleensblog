In all the excitement of recent months I forgot to mention that a couple of weeks ago we finished work on an update to [The Outpost](http://outpostpdx.com/) website. Blend modes! Viewport units! object-fit magic! This teaser combines a lot of the techniques that [I’ve been learning about](https://css-tricks.com/author/robinrendle/) into one exciting project.

But, after seeing the [constant stream](https://twitter.com/outpostpdx) of good news emanating from the space and the [current line-up of members and patrons](https://medium.com/@waxpancake/the-outpost-is-here-9d247013a304#.cerbsssux) that have joined up, I can’t help but feel extraordinarily jealous. The two Andys are going to make that space really special in the weeks and months to come.
