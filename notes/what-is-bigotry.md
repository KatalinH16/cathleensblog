This is a fabulous video by ContraPoints about J.K. Rowling, anti-trans sentiments, and [what bigotry really is](https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us). I love Natalie’s videos for so many reasons—but this video reminds me why. Each of her arguments are like shots from an orbital laser cannon pointed at the earth, obliterating everything along it's path. Natalie points at all the half-assed, lazy, incendiary language that folks use in casual conversation and shows us what it really means, how people really think. And then she burns all those arguments to the ground.

Every time I listen to her I walk away feeling smarter.
