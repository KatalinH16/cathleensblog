I love the look of this: [Occupant Oldstyle](https://occupantfonts.com/fonts/occupant-oldstyle/) by Cyrus Highsmith and and June Shin. It’s a perfect addition to the Occupant Fonts library; Oldstyle is playful and silly—look at that Q!—and yet seriously constructed—look at the numbers!

> The rounded triangular endings are the result of a long fermentation process that combines ingredients from Japanese Mincho style typefaces, rounded sans serifs, electronic music, and toys. Highsmith calls them ‘child-safe serifs’.

If you have a sec, make sure to go through their back catalogue of work, like [Ibis Display](https://occupantfonts.com/fonts/ibis-display/) or [Zócalo Text](https://occupantfonts.com/fonts/zocalo-text/). It’s all wondrous.
