I’ve been really enjoying [brr](https://brr.fyi/), a blog from a chap who works in IT at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. They write about basically everything, from [hunkering down for winter](https://brr.fyi/posts/sunset)...

> South Pole Station sits at near-exactly 90° South latitude. Down here, the sun does weird things. This leads to strange but accurate sentences, such as “can you believe it – only 4 more days until sunset”.

...to the strange and curious [doors](https://brr.fyi/posts/doors-of-mcmurdo) on the station:

> This is not a master-planned community. Rather, it is a series of organic responses to evolving operational needs.
>
> The buildings reflect this patchwork approach. Each building has its own unique style, based on when it was built, the standards at the time, the parties involved in its construction and operation, and what role it plays in town.
>
> Nothing more clearly illustrates this than the doors to the buildings.
