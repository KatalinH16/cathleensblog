[Bond](http://bond.backerkit.com/) is a new conference set in San Francisco this March 9-10 that “examines how creators make a living through the internet.” I just picked up my tickets and yet I have no idea what to expect, besides the fact that this is a project by [Andy McMillan](http://goodonpaper.com/) and so there is only one thing to expect really; an event that happens to be completely outstanding.

I’m looking forward to the conference itself but I wanted to make a quick note about the website, designed by [Paulo](http://paulo.is). In fact, Bond is the sort of website that reminds me why I wanted to become a web designer in the first place; beautiful typography, short and to the point writing, luscious illustrations that ooze across the whole page. It’s a visual delight that’s much more than surface-level loveliness.

To be honest, whenever Paulo shows me what he’s working on there’s always this intense pang of jealousy I feel in the pit of my stomach. It’s the good sort of jealousy though. It’s the type of feeling that makes me want to stand up and try that extra bit harder to impress my friends, all of whom happen to be much smarter and kinder than I am.

Anyway, I hope you’re all coming along because I’ll certainly be there, ready-as-ever to learn about how to live and work on the internet.
