The latest album by HAIM, _Women in Music Pt.III_, has been on infinite repeat for the last couple of days. Their music is like a fantastical broth between PJ Harvey, Shania Twain, and One Little Plane.

Also, they happen to be [upsettingly good live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGILMne88AA) and earlier this year they made [the best music video of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crZvtA9I4lY). Ugh!
