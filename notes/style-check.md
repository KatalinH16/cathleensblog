I’m late to the party here but this week I discovered that iA Writer has a feature they call [Style Check](https://ia.net/writer/blog/introducing-style-check) which suggests superfluous words to remove:

> It’s not like any of the existing grammar checkers or functions. There is no AI, it is not smarter than you, and it doesn’t steal your texts. It makes you think about what you say. And yet it can improve your writing instantaneously.

I’ve used it over the past few days and it’s just the sort of nudge I need to remove words that don’t _really_ need to stick around. But this also reminds me of Chris’s notes on [words to avoid](https://css-tricks.com/words-avoid-educational-writing/) when it comes to educational writing.
