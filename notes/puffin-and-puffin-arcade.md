Here’s some nifty new fonts from Bold Monday: [Puffin](https://boldmonday.com/typeface/puffin/) and [Puffin Arcade](https://www.boldmonday.com/typefaces/puffin-arcade/), designed by Pieter van Rosmalen. I particularly like the Arcade variant since it’s not often that a font elicits a loud _oooooo!_ when I see it for the first time.

Puffin Arcade is a bitmap font with variants like those found in [classic arcade games](https://readonlymemory.vg/shop/book/arcade-game-typography/); Dither, Nerf, Liquid, Warp, Wipe, Yoko, Tate, Level, and Foozle.
