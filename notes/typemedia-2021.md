[TypeMedia](https://typemedia.org/) is a type design masters program in the Netherlands and each year a graduating class of designers band together to make a little website showcasing their work. I get real excited for these because they’re always a delight and the work from [2021](https://2021.typemedia.org/) is certainly no different. Shocking shapes! Curious, distorted glyphs! Gah!

Ivo Brouwer’s outrageously pretty typeface [Surround](https://2021.typemedia.org/ivo.html) is the one that caught my eye first though:

Holy woof, Batman! As soon as I saw this thing I wanted to plaster it on a million book covers and experiment with each of the different layers. Here’s how Ivo describes it:

> Surround is a chromatic typeface system made for playful typesetting. It consists of 5 unique styles, that can be used both individual and superimposed.

Playful indeed. You can stack these letters on top of each other and get an imperfect, risograph zine-like-look. I think that you have to be pretty careful with the colors here though as some of the options feel really hard to read. Also: I would love to see a thinner version of Surround.

But—all of this is incredibly exciting (look at [Zalfia](https://2021.typemedia.org/neva.html)!). And if you’re interested in learning more about what the course is like, you can read this piece by Stephen Nixon about [what he learned at TypeMedia](https://www.typefloundry.com/things-learned-at-typemedia.html).
