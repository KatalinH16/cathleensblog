  "“Do you mind if I tell you, while I have your ear? All of this, the funeral,
  the family, the sudden reminder that life ends, it makes me realize how ignorant
  I am. I'm so sure I'm clever and sophisticated, a smug little agnostic, but put
  me face forward with death, and I don't know my right from my north...”"

I’ve been going back through [Ftrain](http://ftrain.com) thanks to [Paul Ford’s talk at XOXO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSL5qVL3Mng), and there’s a wondrous archive bundled up in this old site of his—years and years of journal entries. [This post](http://www.ftrain.com/archive_ftrainone_920607237.html) about his grandfather’s funeral is particularly eye-popping:

> Do you mind if I tell you, while I have your ear? All of this, the funeral, the family, the sudden reminder that life ends, it makes me realize how ignorant I am. I'm so sure I'm clever and sophisticated, a smug little agnostic, but put me face forward with death, and I don't know my right from my north. All the rules for social interaction, all the solid clues and codes and handshakes sublimate into the air. Well-written proposals, a steady paycheck, making rent, building the next generation of web sites--these things don't hold up next to death. Death blows them over like a hurricane through a shantytown.

In the talk, Paul also mentions a poem by the 13th century Persian poet [Jelaluddin Rumi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi) called the _Guest House_. It feels somewhat complimentary to what Paul wrote above:

> This being human is a guest house.
> Every morning a new arrival.
>
> A joy, a depression, a meanness,
> some momentary awareness comes
> as an unexpected visitor.
>
> Welcome and entertain them all!
> Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,
> who violently sweep your house
> empty of its furniture,
> still, treat each guest honorably.
> He may be clearing you out
> for some new delight.
>
> The dark thought, the shame, the malice
> meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.
>
> Be grateful for whatever comes
> because each has been sent
> as a guide from beyond.
