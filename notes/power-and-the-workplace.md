Mandy Brown followed these notes to their next logical conclusion in [her excellent newsletter](https://buttondown.email/aworkinglibrary/archive/office-politics-a-working-letter/):

> When we talk about politics belonging outside the workplace, we reduce democracy to an extracurricular instead of a core part of our lives. Democracy cannot be sustained by annual visits to the ballot box—it isn’t something we have, it’s something we practice.
