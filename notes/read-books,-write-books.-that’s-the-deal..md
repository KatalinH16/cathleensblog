[Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2018/05/22/3-thoughts-on-a-decade-of-publishing-books/):

> In my work, [problems of output are problems of input](https://austinkleon.com/2015/11/12/problems-of-output-are-problems-of-input/). If my work sucks, it’s usually because I’m not being a good enough fan. I need to read, and read voraciously, searching for that thing that’s going to get me back on track. Read books, write books, repeat. That’s the deal.

> I remember sitting in the audience during readings and wanting so badly to be the person on stage. Now I find myself relishing any chance I get to be a fan again. I love pointing to people’s work and sharing the stuff that I love. I love linking to great books in my newsletter. I love sending my agent links to good writers looking for an agent. One of my far-out dreams is to have my own little publishing imprint.
