For a good long while I’ve been helping out with the [CSS-Tricks newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/newsletters/) every week(ish). Each issue is jam packed with our thoughts about front-end development and design.

We try pretty hard to make sure there’s something interesting going on and even though we talk about the latest news we hope to deliver something more than just a bundle of links each week. There are stories about how the team has messed up and what we’re working on next. It’s fun! So if you happen to be interested in the web then I’d suggest you [sign up](https://css-tricks.com/newsletters/#mc-embedded-subscribe-form) and follow along.
