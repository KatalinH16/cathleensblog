> Herb Lubalin and his studios created a vast number of logos over the years. In a career that spanned over 40 years, Lubalin easily created over a hundred marks. Some were corporate logos, some were for non-profits, some were merely tight lock-ups that could act as titles on books, or seen on ads. The range is pretty spectacular.

No kidding. This is a great website that’s dedicated to [Herb Lubalin’s work](https://readymag.com/flatfile/11-logotypes/) and showcases some of the charming logotypes he made over that time. Also! After clicking around Flat File site for a bit I spotted [this post](https://readymag.com/flatfile/01-fact/intro/) and I like how they’ve added a tiny camera icon to reveal who the person is in the story. I always get a bit excited whenever I see novel ways to hypertext.

Oh and this also reminds me of the story about [Herb Lubalin and the first floor](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/the-first-floor).
