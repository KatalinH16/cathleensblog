Bookmarking this post from Kris Sowersby all about his new type family, [Epicene](https://klim.co.nz/blog/epicene-design-information/):

> Epicene Text & Display are Baroque typefaces inspired by the work of two 18th century maestros: J-F. Rosart and J.M. Fleischmann. Typographically, Epiceneâ€™s exaggerated details add rigour at small sizes and vigour at large sizes. Culturally, Epicene says one thing: typefaces have no gender.

Writing about type and _especially_ type history is tough, but here Kris makes it look easy.
