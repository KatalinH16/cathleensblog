Sometimes you don’t want to get distracted by flashy fonts and colors and what you really need is a great typeface that looks handwritten. But the other day I struggled finding something appropriate so, [after asking around](https://sfba.social/@fonts/110385024562097910), I’m noting the best ones here for future reference.

I’ll keep adding to this list, so [lemme know](mailto:robinjrendle@gmail.com) if I’ve missed anything great here.
