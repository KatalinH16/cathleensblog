[The Book Cover Review](https://bookcoverreview.co.uk/) is a great project by [David Pearson](https://www.instagram.com/typeasimage/); it’s a website with quick, 500-word reviews of book covers from guest designers, typographers, and writers. It all looks lovely! Fine typesetting, cute and slightly odd navigation, and gorgeous pictures to boot.

There’s only one unforgiveable flaw with this project: there’s no RSS feed. But it does look like this is an ongoing thing that folks will keep contributing to, so I’ll just keep popping back now and again to see what’s changed.
