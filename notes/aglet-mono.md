For more than a week I’ve had a tab open just for [Aglet Mono](https://xyztype.com/fonts/aglet_mono) from XYZ Type and I can’t seem close it. And in a world overrun by _ehhhhh_ lookin’ monospace fonts, I think this one stands up and has something new to say. It has all the oomph of FF Meta, and the rounded loveliness of Aglet Slab:

I feel bad dunking on a lot of monospace fonts but every other week I see folks mention the latest fancy thing and I kinda sigh a tiny bit because they’re not doing anything new. They’re covering the same ground as things that have come before them with no twist, no dash of inspiration.

Okay, enough moaning, back to work!
