Someone asked a group of engineers in our Slack channel this question the other day and I spent a whole bunch of time thinking about it. What do I wish I had known about engineering before I had started? What would have helped me the most? What’s been the biggest mistake I’ve made so far?

Well, I wish I had known that the genius engineer is simply a myth and I wish I had known that working alone is almost a complete waste of time.
