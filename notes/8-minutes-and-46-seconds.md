Dave Chappelle’s latest show on the murder of George Floyd, [8:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4):

> ...he’s not a hero and why does the black community make him a hero? Why do you choose him as a hero? WE didn’t choose him, YOU did. They killed him and that wasn’t right, so he’s the guy. We’re not desperate for heroes in the black community—anyone that survives this nightmare is my goddamned hero.
