This new ebook-esque Gameboy-cartridge playin’ synthesizer called [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket/) looks nifty. I like the design of the site here because it squares up neatly with my theory that the best websites are in fact secret essays. And I also reckon that thinking about a website like an essay is helpful because then we can start to push back against certain trends or requirements of modern web design.

This reminds me of Panic’s [PlayDate](https://play.date/) console that they announced not so long ago, not only because the design aesthetics for the hardware are a bit similar but also since the website is an essay! I wonder if I should make a collection of these sorts of sites for future reference. [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) is one such website that I think about often.
