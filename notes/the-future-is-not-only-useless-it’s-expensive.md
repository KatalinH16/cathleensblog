[Dan Brooks](https://www.gawker.com/culture/the-future-is-useless-expensive):

> This is how NFTs make me feel: like the future is useless but expensive, and world-altering technology is now in the hands of a culture so aesthetically and spiritually impoverished that it should maybe go back to telling stories around the cooking fire for a while, just to remember how to mean something.

This is the problem with the _aesthetics_ of this stuff, but Dan also writes about the philosophical problems with it, too. It’s art as pure commerce, solely transactional. NFT tech is not a fun and experimental playground like in the early days of the web, but a cruel and manipulative grift that is ultimately bad for us all.
