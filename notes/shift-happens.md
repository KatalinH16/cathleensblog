Marcin’s upcoming book about typewriters, _Shift Happens_, now has [a glorious website](https://shifthappens.site/) where you can see what the finished thing is going to look like:

> Shift Happens is full of stories – some never before told – interleaved with 1,000+ beautiful full-color photos across two volumes. This edition features an extra volume of additional illustrations and “making of” material, and everything comes wrapped in a slipcase. It’s a great gift for keyboard or typewriter aficionados, but also suits everyone who cares about design, the stories of everyday objects, or tech history.

Oh and make sure to check out the bananas 3D demo where you can click around the book and see just how much work Marcin has poured into this project. I’m so very excited to get my hands on the finished thing; it’s going to be really quite special.
