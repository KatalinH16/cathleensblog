A couple of months ago I moved my day-to-day internet life to Mastodon and you can find me here:

It almost, sort of, kinda feels like the fowl place back in 2008 or so when folks shared pictures of cool daffodils and micro-blogged the heck out of their coffee run instead of pandering for likes and retweets with hot takes. But I contributed to that, too! And I feel bad about it! Although I’m still hopeful that Mastodon won’t turn into that! We’ll see!

To be honest, I don’t know what my relationship with the internet will look like after the heat death of the fowl place. For now I’m just gonna focus on this here website, but this new timeline feels like an okay place to lurk in the short term.
