This week I signed my first <abbr title="Non-disclosure agreement">NDA</abbr> and worked with the team at #######. I had a great time doing a lot of ########. Of course there might have been one or two ##### ####### but then again it could have been ###### # #######. I’m very much looking forward to this ##### and consequently ########## #### becoming a real thing.

In other news there isn’t much other news. On the side I’ve been writing for a couple of my favourite publications, although nothing’s ready to talk about just yet. That sounds like bragging and it totally isn’t bragging, I’m just saying that hey these things take time and some of my week notes might be a little sparse—and that’s ok: _festina lente_.

## Non-work related notes

Of all the many secret dating services that are out there, [Codepen](http://codepen.io) is my favourite.

I’ve been munching over that bit in [_Tigerman_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tigerman-Nick-Harkaway/dp/043402287X) where the protagonist is thinking about what success looks like when it arrives:

> More progress. Part of him was almost alarmed, but he knew it happened this way sometimes, knew that when it did you had to ride the wave and choose your options well to keep it under your feet. It looked like a sudden turn for the better because humans saw what was in front of them, didn’t look at the time spent getting to a certain point. This was not a day of success, it was the success of many days, the pay-off of effort.

A host of whiney, East coast indie-rockers have been keeping my ears busy this week:

- I’ve especially been listening to [Roland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtePaSU5Lpg) over and over and over and over again.
- And this live version of [I Will Possess Your Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhj2RqqT1O8)
- Oh and on a completely unrelated note I’ve started digging into [No Such Thing as a Fish](https://soundcloud.com/nosuchthingasafish)

Earlier today [Charlie](http://twitter.com/vruba) said some awfully smart and space-lovin’ words on the [Mapbox blog](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/dscovr/) about <abbr>DSCVOR</abbr>:

> The main goal of DSCOVR’s Earth observation is to improve climate models. By continuously measuring how the atmosphere, land, and water of the planet absorb and reflect sunlight, scientists will learn more about long-term patterns and trends. The science is vital, but I’m more interested in the images themselves. If we think of the famous Blue Marble photograph from Apollo 17 in 1972 as a portrait, DSCOVR will be a webcam: a picture of our homeworld updating in near-realtime, in constant motion through days and seasons.
