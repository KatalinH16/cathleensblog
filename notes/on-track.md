I can’t remember the last time I felt quite like this. There’s a sense that everything’s on track and progress is being made; my day to day work isn’t quite as scary as it was a year ago (in fact now I’m beginning to feel like this whole career of mine might’ve been a good idea after all) also I’m feeling like my home is no longer a temporary resting ground or campsite. I have a rug and a candle and a small batch of close friends in San Francisco.

Beyond any work or any technical skills that I’d like to improve this coming year though, I’d like to focus on activism. Political and civil activism to be more exact. So learning the name and politics of the mayor, Senator, and Congresswoman of my state is a small start but it’s not enough.

2018 is the year I learn how my new home works.
