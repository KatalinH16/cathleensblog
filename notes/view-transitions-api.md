extract: How does this change web design in the future?
---

I can’t look at [Dave’s tutorial about the View Transitions API](https://daverupert.com/2023/05/getting-started-view-transitions/) without my mind racing through all the possibilities here. How does this change web design in the future? Do websites even use frameworks if all you need for some app-like animations is a few lines of JavaScript and CSS?

Looks like Jake Archibald also has [a great tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/) that shows what’s going to be possible soon and Chris has collected [a ton of recent examples](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/05/18/early-days-examples-of-view-transitions/) now that View Transitions has landed in a version of Chrome behind a flag.

Not to sound too romantic or anything but I can imagine that this could change the texture and feeling of websites in the future. That app-like-slickness is something that web folks have dreamed of for years (although I’ve always been cynical about and kinda pushed back against on my own projects — I want my websites to feel like websites).

Anyway, even this cynical jerk is excited about this thing.

(I wonder what kind of weirdo transition stuff I can make with the next essay...)
