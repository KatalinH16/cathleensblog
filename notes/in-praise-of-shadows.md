Pals! Nerds! Photo-buddies! I just hit the big green publish button on a new essay called _[In Praise of Shadows](https://robinrendle.com/essays/in-praise-of-shadows)_. Here’s the cover:

It’s an essay about photography and my new camera, the FujiFilm X100V, but it’s also about what I’ve learned over the past six months; where to put my feet, how to line things up, how to edit photographs. It’s about a bunch of mistakes I’ve made and it’s also about how this camera has changed how I see the world a bit.

But the real exciting thing to me about all this is really the format.

It’s a big scrolly essay (optimized mostly for your phone) and you can click anywhere to progress or turn back to a previous "slide". Also, the images that I’m describing in the essays are hidden, mischeviously obfuscated by the text that sits on top:

I know some people already kinda don’t like this (how can you have an essay about photography without showing me the photograph!) but that’s all part of the fun. I’m not a great photographer, and really the pictures I’m taking are not as important as what I’ve learned over the last six months. Plus, it creates this air of mystery that I like.

Anyway, that’s it. I’d love your thoughts/unrelenting praise if you have any. Go read this thing!
