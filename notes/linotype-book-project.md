Back in 2012, Doug Wilson made one of those Defining Media Objects for me—a fantastic movie called [Linotype: The Film](https://watch.linotypefilm.com/). Watching it then in college, it certainly pushed me towards publishing and typography and learning about these beautiful old machines.

Now, ten years later, Doug is [writing the book](https://linotypebook.com/) with his newsletter documenting the progress along the way and—go sign up! Support Doug! This is going to be a fantastic book, a fantastic project, and I’m thrilled to watch this Defining Media Object turn into another ten years later.
