[Rachel Sugar](https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/05/in-praise-of-the-walking-coffee.html):

> Walking doesn’t improve the taste of coffee, but coffee improves the experience of being in the world. It blunts the harsher edges. Without coffee, there is “public space” and “private space.” With coffee, the whole city is your living room.
>
> Usually, I think only rich people and babies get to blur these sorts of boundaries. Babies get security blankets; rich people get status sweatpants. The rest of us are supposed to generally contain ourselves.
>
> Walking coffee is the exception. Walking coffee is its own kind of security blanket. You don’t even have to drink it, really; just holding the coffee is enough. What matters is not the coffee but the possibility of coffee. With walking coffee in your hand, you are the master of your destiny.
