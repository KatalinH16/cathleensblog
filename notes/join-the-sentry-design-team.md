extract: We’re looking for a UI engineer.
---

The design team at Sentry is hiring a [UI engineer](https://sentry.io/careers/2988841/) in San Francisco (no remote, sadly) and so this is a rare opportunity: if you like design systems, front-end development, and shouting at me when I rant about CSS for too long then please reach out and let me know.

Because I want to work with a great UI engineer to help build our design system and work on making our front-end outstanding.

Also, I know I’ve talked a lot about Sentry lately but there’s a good reason why. I think our team is doing extraordinary work—it’s perhaps the first full-time job I’ve ever loved. There’s no politics, no faffing about with endless meetings that lead nowhere. There’s just a lot of actual, honest-to-goodness work to get done.

So get in touch and let’s make something neat.
