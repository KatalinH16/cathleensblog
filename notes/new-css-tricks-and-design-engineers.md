On [the subject of design engineers](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/239-new-css-tricks-and-design-engineers/) that’s been getting some attention in the front-end community lately (yes I am quoting myself, shut up):

> The problem (which I didn’t realize at the time) was that the organization I worked for was ignoring this front-of-the-front-end work and painted everything with the same brush—treating everything as “engineering.”
>
> But when you don’t break up the team into these specialist groups, then that’s how these problems in the front-end begin.
>
> If an organization doesn’t believe in front-of-the-front-end, then that’s going to cause all sorts of anxiety for the people who naturally fit into that role but can’t. So, if you’re feeling that you need to pick a side between design and engineering, then perhaps you’re a “design engineer.”
>
> We need engineers, we need designers, and we absolutely need design engineers to make that connection across the great divide between the front-of-the-front-end and the back-of-the-front-end. It’s only then that we can make truly great things together.
