Stephen Coles celebrates Typographica’s 20th year with a look back through the archives and [how the site began](https://typographica.org/on-typography/typographica-is-twenty-years-old/):  

> Looking back at the bite-size, mostly-text, link-laden posts of those first few months, it becomes clear: early Typographica was essentially Type Twitter before there was Twitter. It was a daily stream of links to and from other blogs, of breaking industry news that wouldn’t get covered in printed media until weeks later, of projects and observations, deep thoughts and plain silliness.

I’m a huge fan of Typographica and I hope that, with the renewed interest in blogging and caring for our own private places on the web, Typographica can continue to flourish.
