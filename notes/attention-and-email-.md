Almost every life-changing event for me started as an email, so email is way more important than I give it credit for. I should take better care of them, and I’ve written before about how I need to send more nice emails to folks to say thanks and/or hi. But: if someone’s a jerk, or they write to me as if I owe them something then nah. No email. No reply. And not sorry.

I know this is daring, bold, and some might even say courageous—but!—you absolutely do not need to reply to an email if you don’t want to. No one _deserves_ your time and attention. Email is a request, not a demand.

I get the sense that a lot of people reply to every email because of this? Because maybe 80% of the folks who email me expect a swift reply (and I’m not at all bragging here since the amount of email I get from actual humans is way, way lower than most folks). But the humans that do email me always act as if we’re halfway through a conversation—and how dare I not respond to them! We were talking!

This, I think, is kinda shitty.

But if you’re reaching out about something earnestly? Heck yes. I want every single one of those, since they’re life-giving stuff. The Email of Emails. It’s the reason why computers exist.

I need all of them.
