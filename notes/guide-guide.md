I love everything about [Guide Guide](https://guideguide.me/) by [Cameron McEfee](https://cameronmcefee.com/)—it’s a plugin for design tools that allows you to create complex grid systems real easy. On the website, Cameron writes:

> We’ve gone soft. Our modern design tools, great as they are, hold our hands in the direction of what is easy to build and optimize. They deprioritize whack-ass ideas that scare product managers but are cool as sh*t when someone has the audacity to make them work.
> 
> GuideGuide raises a middle finger to tools that limit creative potential. If you’re a designer that wants to do work that is different from the rest, GuideGuide will help you do it.

I’ve always loved how Cameron writes. The whole website is so well written in fact that even [the documentation](https://guideguide.me/documentation) makes for a fun and pleasant read.
