Nick Sherman’s flickr group called [Text on a Curve](https://www.flickr.com/groups/textonacurve/) is just neat as hell. And this example from Patricia is especially beautiful; [The Fan Safety Matches](https://www.flickr.com/photos/taffeta/4924587795/in/pool-textonacurve/).

I’ve never set text on a curve because getting it right is so damn hard, so I also loved the description of all the different ways to set text like this in the Group Description section; rotate, arch, fan, and distort.

I’m sure I’ll come back to this diagram at some point soon.
