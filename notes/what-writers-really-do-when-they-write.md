extract:
  "“A guy (Stan) constructs a model railroad town in his basement. Stan acquires
  a small hobo, places him under a plastic railroad bridge, near that fake campfire,
  then notices he’s arranged his hobo into a certain posture – the hobo seems to be
  gazing back at the town. Why is he looking over there?”"

George Saunders on [the art of fiction writing](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/04/what-writers-really-do-when-they-write):

> A guy (Stan) constructs a model railroad town in his basement. Stan acquires a small hobo, places him under a plastic railroad bridge, near that fake campfire, then notices he’s arranged his hobo into a certain posture – the hobo seems to be gazing back at the town. Why is he looking over there? At that little blue Victorian house? Stan notes a plastic woman in the window, then turns her a little, so she’s gazing out. Over at the railroad bridge, actually. Huh. Suddenly, Stan has made a love story. Oh, why can’t they be together? If only “Little Jack” would just go home. To his wife. To Linda.

> What did Stan (the artist) just do? Well, first, surveying his little domain, he noticed which way his hobo was looking. Then he chose to change that little universe, by turning the plastic woman. Now, Stan didn’t exactly decide to turn her. It might be more accurate to say that it occurred to him to do so; in a split-second, with no accompanying language, except maybe a very quiet internal “Yes.”
