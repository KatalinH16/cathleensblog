extract: And learning to think inside it.

There’s a wonderful quote by Aza Raskin, although I’ve forgotten where he said it now, but I think it about all the time. He argued that:

> Design is not about learning to think outside the box, it’s about finding the right box to think inside of.

And when it comes to design systems I think that’s exactly what’s so tough
about it. Not only do you have to learn when and how to draw the box to
think inside of, but you have to get everyone else in an organization to think inside of that box, too.
