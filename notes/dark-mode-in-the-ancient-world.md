Whoa, [@maya](https://maya.land/responses/2023/08/01/dark-mode-in-the-ancient-world.html). I’ve never heard of a black Book of Hours like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hours,_Morgan_MS_493) before. What an absurdly beautiful thing:

> The lettering is inscribed in silver and gold and placed within borders ornamented with flowers, foliage and grotesques, on pages dyed a deep blueish black.
