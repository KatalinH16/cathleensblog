Nicky Case writes about [why RSS was so damn good](https://ncase.me/rss/):

> Imagine an open version of Twitter or Facebook News Feed, with no psy-op ads, owned by no oligopoly, manipulated by no algorithm, and all under your full control.
>
> Imagine a version of the newsletter where you don't have to worry about them selling your email to scammers, labyrinth-like unsubscribe pages, or stuffing your inbox with ever more crap.
>
> Now imagine this existed and was extremely popular 15 years ago. Then we got suckered by the shiny walled gardens.
>
> Well, it's time to make like a tree and go back to the future, baby!
