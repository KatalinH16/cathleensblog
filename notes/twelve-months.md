This time last year I was a pup. I had never used Sass before, I didn’t know what a shell was, and the DOM was a ghostly, nightmarish thing that infiltrated my dreams.

Time has zipped by since I joined Erskine a year ago today and I’m now looking back at how I’ve spent my days so far. _What have I learned? What can I be doing better?_

There are so many lessons, screw ups and questions left unanswered in between. So many dumb questions and so much wasted, hot air expelled. Hours of stumbling through documentation at night and wondering if I could ever make just this _one damn thing_ work.

I’ve spent the last twelve months learning, basically. Learning the long hard, stupid way. And I wouldn’t want to have done it anywhere else.
