Via [Robin’s newsletter](https://www.robinsloan.com/) I just spotted this release on Future Fonts of [Nichrome](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/mass-driver/nichrome) by Mass-Driver, “a display face referencing the typography of paperback science fiction from the 70s and early 80s.” And these numbers in particular are rather striking—make sure to look very closely at that 3:

I’m an enormous fan of Mass-Driver and Rutherford Craze’s work, going so far as to use his [MDSystem](https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-system) type family not so long ago for [Dartmoor, Death Stranding, and me](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/dartmoor-death-stranding-and-me).
