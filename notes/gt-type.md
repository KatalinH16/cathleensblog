For some reason today I find myself scouring through the archives of [Grilli Type](https://www.grillitype.com/) and I particularly love the catalogue page where they show a list of every family available:

It’s a simple layout without any flair, but dang I just want to buy every single typeface here. Like the ever-so-weird [GT Alipna Condensed Bold](https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-alpina)! Or [GT Walsheim Condensed](https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-alpina), a geometric-inspired sans that I just can’t stop staring at:
