Here’s a beautiful book called the [_Manual of Diacritics_](http://manualofdiacritics.eu/) by Radek Sidun. Diacritics are those peculiar shapes above and below characters that are mostly absent in English—`façade` and `naïve` are those rare leftovers—but these marks are extremely important for many languages where the words will fail to make sense without them. And so Radek’s manual here proves that these marks have a utility, and we should care for them just as we should any other type of punctuation, but these diacritics are stunning, too. And we should gawp at them all night long.

I’m excited to pick up a copy of this thing.
