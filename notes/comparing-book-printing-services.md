Ages ago, [Marcin](https://aresluna.org/) wrote this great piece about [printing a small batch of books](https://mwichary.medium.com/my-experiences-printing-a-small-batch-of-books-c04141b63dfe):

> I’ve recently found myself wanting to print a small run (15 copies) of a book. I approached this knowing pretty well what I wanted: a simple, old-school book with…letters in it:

This is mostly a note for me soon, but it’s amazing that with just a few clicks you can get a book you wrote printed and sent to your front door. And I’m sure things have changed a lot since Marcin wrote this piece back in 2016, but I’ll be using these notes soon.

Also if you have any recommendations for better book-on-demand services then let me know!
