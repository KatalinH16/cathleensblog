It’s not often that a website makes me gasp but [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/) did the trick. It’s a D’n’D-esque game which I don’t know much about but the overall weirdness of this game and the website itself is just...beautiful.

Take the footnotes, for example:

> Remember: Make it dark, depressing, weird and cruel. But let everyone partake in the suffering. Be sure to avoid sexist, racist, homophobic and transphobic tropes and themes in your content. There's plenty of that crap in the real world already. The world of MÖRK BORG doesn't need it.

I have no idea what’s going on here. But there’s tons of typefaces to look at! I think one of them is Fakir?
