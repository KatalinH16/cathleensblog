Somehow I had missed this excellent blog post from Reagan Ray about [the lettering in Marvel comics](https://reaganray.com/2021/04/06/marvel-lettering.html):

> ...like most lettering, right around the late 90s, it all went to shit. The hand-lettering masterpieces were abandoned for fonts and photoshop effects. With that said, I limited this post to the pre-'00s. I wanted to do something more vintage, but there are just too many from the 80s and 90s that I love. My absolute favorite was seeing all the interpretations of 3D type.
