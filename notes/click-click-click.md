One thing I love about Sentry is that it's [an open source](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) project which means that you can go ahead and look at [every line of code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commits?author=robinrendle) I've written over the past year.

You can see me slowly [refactoring our typography](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/25f5be962fcc05619fd13e837b0f11245a126204), deleting [unused bootstrap CSS](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/8a102aa68d45792cf233db75d7f76c3540f35eb0), and [replacing our old coding font](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/8a102aa68d45792cf233db75d7f76c3540f35eb0), Monaco, with IBM Plex.

_Click, click, click._

I don’t know why this is so exciting but perhaps it’s because it feels like blogging, in a way. There’s this warm feeling I get when working/blogging/typing like this in public, a feeling where we can all learn from each other and how we’re all just figuring out how to type better.

I get this same feeling reading through my RSS feed; constant improvement and momentum, without being unhealthy.
