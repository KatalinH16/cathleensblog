Anil Dash writing about how Instagram is controlling behavior by [limiting the use of hyperlinks](https://anildash.com/2019/12/10/link-in-bio-is-how-they-tried-to-kill-the-web/):

> If anyone on Instagram can just link to any old store on the web, how can Instagram — meaning Facebook, Instagram’s increasingly-overbearing owner — tightly control commerce on its platform? If Instagram users could post links willy-nilly, they might even be able to connect directly to their users, getting their email addresses or finding other ways to communicate with them. Links represent a threat to closed systems.
