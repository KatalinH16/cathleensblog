_Adventures in Typography_ is back, folks! After a far too long hiatus I’m bringing this little newsletter back for what I’m calling Season 3—I’ll publish one each Sunday from now until spring. That way I can give myself a goal without it being too overwhelming and exhuasting.

You can read [the first edition](https://buttondown.email/robinrendle/archive/newsletters/) over on Buttondown and I’ll make sure to export it to this very site eventually.
