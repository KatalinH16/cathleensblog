extract: Henning Lederer’s fabulous animated covers

This collection of [animated book covers](http://blog.presentandcorrect.com/cover-stars-2) from Henning Lederer is fascinating and delightful. This video that collects many of these covers is especially worth studying if you’re into animation:

All this has me wondering: what if I take some of these ideas and apply them to the homepage of my site or perhaps to [Volume A](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/volume-a.html)? I feel like a black and white animation on the Kindle like this would be _incredible_. Imagine if instead of a gaudy ad when you locked the screen you’d see a cover of the book you’re currenly reading. When you pick up the device the cover would animate just like this.

Adding this to the endless list of things that would make the Kindle better.
