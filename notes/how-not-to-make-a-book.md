extract: How do you publish an independent book in 2022?
---

I made a lil micro-site for the newsletter I’m kicking off tomorrow morning called [How Not To Make A Book](https://hownottomakeabook.com/). Here is me quoting me:

> There’s almost too much to care for; the design, paper stock, binding, proofreading, logistics, then—not to forget and most important of all—the words you need to write inside. But what does that process look like? And how do you publish an independent book in 2022?
>
> Let’s find out.

I’m hoping to write this newsletter alongside the book and document every bit of drama along the way. Tomorrow I’ll be making the first post so sign up now to get early access to whatever this book might turn into.

Exciting stuff.
