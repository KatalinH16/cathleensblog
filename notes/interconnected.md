The most upsetting thing about Elden Ring is not the difficulty, it’s the sheer imagination of the world building.

A lot of games are like here’s the snow zone, here’s the forest zone, here’s the desert zone. They’re really not much more than aesthetic changes, a touch of paint really.

But Elden Ring says no.

Behold! A half-built city emerging from the bark of an enormous golden tree! Or a winter landscape where giant creatures have been frozen into the landscape! Or a cloud city surrounded by tornadoes and made entirely of dragon bone! Here! Here! Here!

Every five minutes you bump into one magical location after another. And whenever I hit that infamous, impassable wall of difficulty, it was this feeling that kept pushing me forward: What’s behind that wall? What’s under this castle? What’s up on that hill? In most games you know the answer before you ask the question, but in Elden Ring _dear elden lord_ anything is possible.

I worry this game has broken me though. It’s set a new bar for what a world should feel like in a video game; an interconnected, unknowable place.
