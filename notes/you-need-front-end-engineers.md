The strangest thing about front-end development is that itâ€™s such a rare collection of skills that happen to be so undervalued today.

You want accessibility? You need front-end engineers.

You want performance? You need front-end engineers.

You want good design? You need front-end engineers.

The funny thing is that front-end engineers are not compensated in the same way that any other rare employment resource is treated. At least in my experience. So what is it about front-end development that makes it so hard to explain and make the case for?

Why is it so hard for us all to see that front-end development is not only important but vital for our businesses and our day-to-day lives?
