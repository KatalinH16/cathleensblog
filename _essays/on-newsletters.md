      <p>And over the past few years I’ve fallen in love with so many writers through newsletters! On all sorts of subjects!</p>

      <p>...and newsletters about complex systems, showing us how the world is put together.</p>

      <p>Not to mention the smaller newsletters, too. Break-ups! Coffee beans! Clocks! Northumberland flower gardens! And all of these sit side by side with newsletters that are outstandingly, unabashedly&hellip;</p>

      <p>I guess there’s something about newsletters that bugs me, and I can’t put my finger on it.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>It bothers me that writers can’t create audiences on their own websites, with their own archives, and their own formats. And they certainly can’t get paid in the process. (Although yes, there are exceptions).</p>

  </div>

      <p>Heck, just the technical expertise required to have your own website is extremely cumbersome and inaccessible to many.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>But the real advantage with newsletters is that they give us super powers. You don’t need to learn about <abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="Cascading stylesheets">CSS</abbr> or databases to get started.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Despite these super powers, I still think that using email to send words back and forth to each other is just entirely <em>ugh</em>.</p>

      <p>Perhaps I feel this way because reading everything in my inbox is somewhat antiquated. It’s almost as if we’ve gone back to reading off parchment after we invented books.</p>

    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>And we’ve all moved to newsletters at the very moment when websites can do amazing things with layout and typography! We finally have grids and beautiful fonts and the wonders of print design on the web for the first time.</p>

    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>Yet websites are treated as these embarrassing, ugly, ad-riddled things, whilst newsletters have established some kind of prestige for themselves somehow.</p>

    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>And I’m saying this as someone who’s spent the better part of the last three years writing emails to strangers—because I feel both liberated and yet also cursed by them. Newsletters are just&hellip;inescapable if you want to be a writer today.</p>

      <p>But if websites are so great then why did everyone (including me) move to newsletters? Why did blogs die off? Well, there are ten million answers to those questions, but only three I want to focus on.</p>

      <p>It’s called <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>; an ancient, dusty technology that lets you subscribe to a website and see updates as they happen. With an <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> reader app you can see what’s new from your favorite writers.</p>

      <p>I reckon <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> never reached critical scale for websites because it was never built into the browser itself. The failure here wasn’t the technology but the distance between <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and the browser.</p>

      <p>This has been called the original sin of the internet—since you can’t pay someone directly through the browser, the thinking goes, then all these other hacks pop up to squeeze money out of folks; invasive and ugly advertising, privacy-breaking data collection, etc. </p>

      <p>If you have enough technical knowledge or a big enough following then you can build a subscription service for your website. This isn’t possible for a lot of writers though.</p>

      <p>But why should subscribing to a website be any more complex than subscribing to a newsletter? Why do I have to go through Substack or Patreon or the Kindle as a middleman?</p>

      <p>Look—I adore these services because they open the doors for so many new writers and buck wild stories. But that’s only because the web itself is so damn difficult to make work as an independent publishing platform.</p>

      <p>There are neat developments in this space: services such as Coil or web browsers like Puma are worth paying attention to because they’re trying to upend the way that money is distributed on the web today.</p>

      <p>Writers choose a newsletter service like Substack because the business model is straight forward. I just sort of wish this infrastructure was built into the writers’s websites themselves.</p>
