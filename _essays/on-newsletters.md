    An Ode to Newsletters

    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>&hellip;and that’s what newsletters make possible for me; they’re a record of how strangers see the world.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>And over the past few years I’ve fallen in love with so many writers through newsletters! On all sorts of subjects!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">

      <img alt="The Cistern of Philoxenos, a subterranean reservoir in Istanbul" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/06-cistern-philoxenos.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>There are dazzling newsletters; those of grand adventures and epic mysteries&hellip;</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="An enormous wallpaper printing machine" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/07-wallpaper-printing-machine.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>...and newsletters about complex systems, showing us how the world is put together.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="A horseshoe geranium flower" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/08-flower-horseshoe-geranium.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>Not to mention the smaller—although no less ambitious—newsletters, too. Break-ups! Coffee beans! Clocks! Northumberland flower gardens! And all of these sit side by side with newsletters that are outstandingly, unabashedly&hellip;</p>

    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>So I guess my question here is a difficult one to ask, because I love newsletters so very much, but&hellip;</p>
    </div>

      <p>&hellip;is this progress?</p>
    </div>

      <img alt="A sad boy is sat in a chair feeling sad" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/12-sad-boy.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>I guess there’s something about newsletters that bugs me, and I can’t put my finger on it.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="Edison’s electric pen" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/13-edisons-electric-pen.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>It bothers me that writers today can’t create audiences on their own websites, with their own archives, and their own formats. And they certainly can’t get paid in the process whilst writing independently for them. (Although yes, there are exceptions).</p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="A carbonated water factory" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/14-carbonated-water-factory.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>Heck, just the technical expertise required to have your own website is extremely cumbersome and inaccessible to many.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="A man sits in a cave surrounded by coins" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/15-minted-money.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>You might think: ah, newsletters are the future because that’s where the money is!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="A man sits in a cave surrounded by coins" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/16-lilliputian-troops-marching.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>But focusing on the money is the wrong take, I think; the real advantage of newsletters is that they give us super powers as well. You don’t need to learn about HTML or CSS or databases to get started. You pick a service and with three clicks you’re good to go.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="A giant person towers over an army" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/17-sad-boy-zoom.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>And yet—despite these super powers—I still think that using email to send words back and forth to each other just sucks.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="Two people look at a piece of paper" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/18-colonel-stood-by.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>Perhaps I feel this way because reading everything in my inbox is somewhat antiquated. It’s almost as if we’ve gone back to reading off parchment after we invented books.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="Two people look up at a series of beautiful paintings" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/19-comfort-forgive.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>Books are so much better than parchment in the same way that websites are so much better than email.</p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="A person setting metal type" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/20-printing-form.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>And we’ve all moved to newsletters at the very moment when websites can do amazing things with layout and typography! We finally have grids and beautiful fonts and the wonders of print design on the web for the first time.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="Two divers fight an enormous crab" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/21-spider-crab.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>But websites are treated as these embarrassing, ugly, ad-riddled things, whilst newsletters have established some kind of prestige for themselves somehow.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="Zoom into sad boy being sad" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/22-sad-boy.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>Today web designers are so embarrassed by the web that they don’t even call themselves “web designers” at all&hellip;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="Nusretiye Mosque" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/23-nusretiye-mosque.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>And yet the web doesn’t have to be this ugly and embarrassing thing; the web can be made beautiful.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="slide-img">
      <img alt="A table floats into the air" src="/uploads/essays/on-newsletters/24-table-slipped.jpg" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>I’m saying all this as someone who’s spent the better part of the last three years writing emails to strangers; I feel both liberated and yet also cursed by them. Newsletters are simply inescapable if you want to be a writer today.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>But if websites are so great then why did everyone (including me) move to newsletters instead of making more websites? Why did blogs mostly die off? Well, there are ten million reasons, but only three I want to focus on&hellip;</p>

      <p>Newsletters killed blogs because&hellip;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>They’re impossibly easy to publish.</li>
        <li>Your inbox is a notification stream.</li>

      <p>Alternatively, websites today&hellip;</p>
      <ol>

      <p>I don’t think these are problems with the medium, so much as they’re just straight up missing features from browsers. But now because of newsletters, I look back on writing for the web as this clunky, annoying process in comparison; the machine sure is beautiful but it requires so much damn work to get singing.</p>

      <p>You still need to learn HTML and CSS to make a website. You still need to learn about hosting and domain names. You might even be forced to learn what the abbreviation  “CMS” stands for, and I simply refuse to curse you with that knowledge.</p>

      <p>I’m not even talking about the complexity of building bonkers web apps that can geo-locate your cat’s best friend and upload that picture to Hunky Cats dot com. I’m thinking about the web as a series of documents here: just the document writing part of the web hasn’t gotten any easier.</p>

      <p>When you subscribe to a newsletter you don’t have to keep coming back to the source to see if there’s something new. Whenever a writer publishes something then you just get an email.</p>

      <p>It’s called RSS; an ancient, dusty technology that lets you subscribe to a website and see updates as they happen. </p>

      <p>It’s the perfect way to read the web and to keep up to date with things. So much so that I consider my RSS reader (Reeder.app) to be my favorite web browser, not Chrome or Firefox or Safari.</p>

      <p>The problem with RSS is that you need to know that RSS exists, how it works, which websites support it, etc. Like I said: an enormous faff.</p>

      <p>“But RSS was just for nerds!” you might say. Well, RSS-the-technology today is fantastically popular—it’s the machine that powers podcasts. So how can RSS be just for nerds if we use it everyday for podcasts?</p>

    <div class="slide-text">
      <p>I reckon RSS never reached critical scale for websites because it was never built into the browser itself. The failure here wasn’t the technology but the distance between RSS and the browser.</p>

      <p>But if RSS was renamed, rebranded, and brought to the surface of the browser then I expect legions of people would adore it. No longer would you have to give all these strangers your email address to sign up for the newsletter. </p>

      <p>This has been called the original sin of the internet—since you can’t pay someone directly through the browser, the thinking goes, then all these other hacks pop up to squeeze money out of folks; invasive and ugly advertising, privacy-breaking data collection, etc. </p>

      <p>And I guess if you have enough technical knowledge or a big enough following then you can build the infrastructure to make a subscription service for your website. This isn’t possible for a lot of writers though.</p>

      <p>But why should subscribing to a website be any more complex than subscribing to a newsletter? Why do I have to go through Substack or Patreon or the Kindle as a middleman?</p>

      <p>Look—I adore these services because they open the doors for so many new writers and buck wild stories. But that’s only because the web itself is so damn difficult to make work as an independent publishing platform.</p>

      <p>Paying and subscribing to a writer’s work should be one click away, without having to go through a middleman who takes a big percentage off the top.</p>

      <p>There are neat developments in this space: services such as Coil or web browsers like Puma are worth paying attention to because they’re trying to upend the way that money is distributed on the web today.</p>

      <p>There’s also, well, brace yourself: the Web Monetization API. That sounds scary! But I think it’s where things get truly interesting.</p>
