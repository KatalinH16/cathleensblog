<span class='dropcap'>1452</span> was a year of witch hunts and plague. Wild bandits were spreading chaos throughout Europe whilst the latest advances in medicine, transportation and printing were already centuries old. But throughout all of this despair there was a glimmer of hope in the German town of Mainz. It was here that a debt-riddled printer with the enviable name Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg had been tirelessly working on his latest project.

It was a book.

Although it was not just any book, it was a Bible; considerable in weight and breadth. It was the first book to be made with movable type and so it was the first to abandon the scribal tradition where books were written by hand. Gutenberg’s workshop would likely have been a dark, smelly[^1] and cramped place, nonetheless, a true wonder was being cut, inked, illuminated into life. So it’s widely believed that throughout that year Gutenberg invented what we now consider *bookish* objects to be.

Gutenberg’s Bible is wildly different to the books that we read today however, and if we take a closer look at the texts themselves then we start to find a more complex history at work. First, many of the editions of his Bible were printed on vellum[^2] (which is a material made from calf-skin). Secondly, the book was enormous and would require serious exercise[^3] to simply move the tome from one room to another. It’s insides are also strange – for example, when a copy is wrenched open, two monolithic columns of Latin text can be found stretching across each page.

How did Gutenberg create these peculiar letterforms with metal? Well, from court documents in the years leading up to the printing of this 42-line Bible there’s mention of a secret machine which Gutenberg had destroyed before his debtors could take hold of it. Printing in the 15th century was a clandestine activity and if anyone discovered Gutenberg’s process then he feared he’d lose everything. This might also explain why we have so little information[^4] about Johannes and his workshop.

Regardless of this startling lack of evidence, we know that Gutenberg combined preexisting technologies alongside creating his own tools.[^5] There were three crucial parts to his workshop’s cloak and dagger process: the counterpunch and matrix, the type mold and the printing press.[^6]

<div class='flex--md'>
  <div class='press-text'>
    <h5><span class='c-dark type-normal'>1.</span> Counterpunch and matrix</h5>
    <p>A tiny bar of metal known as a counterpunch would be shaped with a knife until it resembled a letter, but in reverse.  A highly skilled punchcutter could take up to a day or more making a single punch depending on its complexity and size. But afterwards, it would then be pressed firmly into another bar of metal called a matrix in which the shape would then ready for the type mold.  <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:De_Vinne_1904_-_Punch_and_matrix.jpg'>Source</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class='press-text'>
    <h5><span class='c-dark type-normal'>2.</span> Type mold</h5>
    <p>The matrix would be locked into the type mold and molten metal would be poured into the top. Once cool, the printer would open the mold and find an exact replica of the original letter inside. And because each page is likely to need more than one particular letter, they would need to print a lot of them. So the faster they could duplicate a letter then the faster they could set the text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='press-text'>
    <h5><span class='c-dark type-normal'>3.</span> Printing press</h5>
    <p>A whole alphabet cast from the mold would be set to form sentences and paragraphs on a tray and then ink would be dabbed across the surface before the paper is pressed down with a turn of the lever. Shown below is Benjamin Franklin’s press and I only include it here because it’s shocking to me just how similar this is to a sketch by Albrecht Dürer made in 1511.</p>

Whereas the counterpunch had been inspired by the work of goldsmiths and the idea of a printing press was most likely borrowed from vineyards, it was the type mold that became Gutenberg’s black magic device. And it was an important secret because it might take a year or so to make an alphabet of metal type but those shapes could then be easily reproduced in the mold. Think of it this way: the type mold was a little cloning machine and once Gutenberg had made multiple copies of every letter then he could effectively print a book for a fraction of the cost. So through all of this engineering and cultural synthesis there was one particular goal in mind:

<figure>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[...] the goal of typography at first had nothing to do with type or design: it had everything to do with saving time. Producing multiple copies of books faster than they could be written was the point of typography: no more and no less.</p>
  </blockquote>

It seems that Gutenberg saw the future of typography as replicating the same format and design[^7] of the monastic scribes, except speeding up the process in between. The choice of letterform, the size of the book, its margins, they were the result of looking at previous examples made by scribes and copying each and every bit. So even with these tools available to them, Gutenburg and his staff weren’t capable of bringing books out of the medieval world and into the Renaissance where they truly belonged.

But what if setting type with metal was an entirely separate discipline from making a book by hand? What if the book could be reinvented for a new era? This act of treason would take about fifty years to spread, but in 1452 it had already begun. Whilst Gutenberg was developing his press in Mainz another very important character in this story was born five hundred miles to the south in the Italian province of Lazio.

Fifty years later, at the turn of the 16th century, Gutenberg’s covert method of printing had spread all across Europe and by the time that Aldus Pius Manutius was an adult almost twenty million books had been printed. Much like Gutenberg, Manutius had grown up in a wealthy household where he had a formal education consisting of Ancient Greek, his favorite language, and Latin. This love of literature and books led to a scholarly life where he comfortably taught princes, but at some point Aldus abandoned his employment and moved to the cultural and commercial hub of Venice where he would jump head first into the ruthless trade of printing.

Manutius had moved to Venice and started his own printshop because his admiration for literature was unquestionable. He believed that books were more than a commodity or an art project – they could also archive and preserve information for the future. In fact, the collector Scott Clemons[^8] argued that Aldus Manutius and his Aldine Press were a sort of modern day [archive.org](https://archive.org/):

<figure>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am haunted by a particular counter-factual history. Namely, a history in which Aldus never existed. […] I think the world would be an immeasurably poorer place had not the right man, Aldus Manutius, been in the right place, Venice, […] at the right time, the fifteenth century.</p>
  </blockquote>

This is thanks to Aldine Press printing Ancient Greek works in their original language, texts that were previously only available in fragile manuscripts were now more likely to survive. By printing several hundred copies the press could recirculate those ideas and ensure that they were less susceptible to being lost from the historical record. But this belief in preservation was complimented by Aldus’ belief that books were more than art objects and the reader should no longer be bound to a desk in order to use them. If they were printed in a smaller format, Aldus reasoned[^9], then they could fit into a reader’s pocket and travel with them wherever they go.

This idea led to the Aldine Press favoring a new format for the book, the Octavo, which was considerably smaller.

The Aldine Press was one of the first to recognize the potential of bookmaking and the responsibility of the printshop. Unlike Gutenberg’s work, Aldus and his team challenged the format and design – in the process they questioned what a book should be.

Comparing Gutenberg’s work alongside Manutius’ might seem ridiculous at first, but I think it’s an interesting thought experiment simply because I believe that Gutenberg’s greatest contribution was not the physical books that he printed – his contribution was his engineering prowess, his synthesis of old and new technologies. However, with Aldus Manutius it was the artifacts of the books themselves that had such a great influence. Without the Aldine Press we would have likely lost a great portion of the Greek literature that exists today.

Whenever I think of Johannes Gutenberg and Aldus Manutius I think of them together, sat at a table, with their books placed before them. They’re criticizing each other’s work. Aldus complains of the weight of Gutenberg’s Bible whilst Johannes smirks and flips through an Aldine octavo. In this fictional meeting there’s an argument brewing between the two of them: what is the future of book design and what are the goals of typography? Whilst Gutenberg is preoccupied with the perfect object, Manutius is obsessed with the protection of culture, the preservation of knowledge, and the growth of literature.

To many typographers this might sound quite surprising, but I don’t think that Manutius primary goal was for typography to be beautiful. Instead, it was to facilitate reading and to preserve the text for as long as possible. And so it might be argued that if Gutenberg can be credited with inventing the process of bookmaking then Manutius provided the reasons for owning a book in the first place.

The interesting part about this imaginary discussion is that I still believe it is taking place in our work today.


But we’re forced to make the concession that the web is unlike any other medium that came before it.


So in my mind Gutenberg’s work is bound up with that contemptible phrase “pixel-perfect.” Today it seems that many designers are under the impression that their work should be perfect — grid columns should add up correctly, ratios should be [tk].



## The web hates beautiful typography

- Adding a reliable grid system in print is simple but on the web the effort in maintaining that amount of code is simply not worth it. Many disagree.
- The search for harmony in typography is overrated.

After exploring the books by the Arion Press it was clear I had never seen a website like these books before; the clear and precise typesetting, the use of illustrations.

How does the web hate typography?

- baseline grids
- perfect ratios for alignment
- orphans
- widows
- webfonts
- performance

But on the contrary, I believe that the web hates the *old* typography. For the moment dealing with orphans and widows is not worth the effort. Typographers go to hideous lengths to ensure that borders

In my opinion we shouldn’t fight what the web wants. Good typography on the web is not the same as good typography in print.




## What limits longform reading on the web?
- A presence (with a book you feel sort of guilty before you finish it)
- offline reading (the network)
- paying for the text (contributions + patrons)

The future of the web is the future of the book and the future of the book is *boring*.

Gutenberg’s primary contribution to the design of these books was his ingenuity and engineering prowess.

## What are the future[s] of typography?

1. Web typography will be ugly.
2. Web typography will be responsive.
3. Web typography will be weird.

- typography is more than text
	- when folks think about typography they typically think about fonts and paragraphs of text or books
	- typography is about legibility, accessibility, economics
- What are the current problems with typography on the web?
	- Web performance + leimited number of web fonts that we can use at any one time
	- Only online reading
	- Stale use of type (unhealthy typographic habits)
	- Inconsistent hyphenation support
	- No easy way to justify the text

- The future of typography is animations! (same as Gutenberg)
- Future(s) of the book
- It’s odd that so many discussions about typography omit the mention of money and economics.
- Type is a business first
- Many of these new technologies influence display text
- Which improvements specifically change body text?
- Display vs. body text
- What is responsive typography?
	- they seem foolish now but perhaps in the near future we’ll be comfortable with the way that text reshapes itself to our environment.

## Near-distant technological improvements to text
Progress on the web can often feel infuriatingly slow, but CSS is only twenty years old[^3] and look at just how much progress has been made! Web fonts, animations and transitions, responsive interfaces — each of these only gained serious traction within the last four years or so and have had a profound effect on web typography.

But since we’re looking towards the many divergent futures of typography then which features are likely to have the greatest impact on typography?

### Progressive web apps
Progressive web apps, or PWAs, have been pushed by Google as a way in which to effectively make websites work more like offline apps that you download from the AppStore. This series of technologies allows a website to work offline and cache content for later use, send notifications just like an app, and can.

In the many demos showcasing the PWAs there’s nothing that excites me more than demos of plain old boring books. I happen to think that PWAs offline function will provide us with a way in which to deliver large chunks of text.[^4]

A PWA helps us make reliable and much more predictable interfaces for reading.


I think PWAs are more than a fad for making websites work more like apps and will instead change some important things about how the web works.



- Fluid type (CSS locks + min/max font-size)
- CSS Grid Layout
- Variable fonts
- Color fonts
- Better display text
- Element/container queries
	- resilient design systems
- These are only short term improvements over the next 3-4 years that are slated to come soon, besides container queries.



## Motivated vs unmotivated readers
Indra Kupferschmid splits typography into two types of user which I find interesting: the *unmotivated* and *motivated* reader.

### Unmotivated reader
• Short, selective reading
• Non-essential content
- advertising, logos, posters, packaging

### Motivated reader
• Long, immersive reading
• Crucial content
- Novels, News, Correspondence, Signage

Whenever I’m setting text I have three goals in mind:

1. attract attention
2. keep the reader focused
3. make communication clear


## ENDING
The danger in typesetting for the web is that we might end up thinking that this will always be how it works — we learn how typesetting has worked up until know and then we don’t take to experiment with new features.

Does this feature improve the reading experience?

if we don’t constantly challenge our preconceptions of what good web typography is then we’ll be doomed to be left behind and unable to help contribute to its future.

## Footnotes and further reading

[^1]: To my horror, when [I visited the American Bookbinding Museum](https://robinrendle.com/adventures/the-last-adventure/) I was told that print shops at the time would have to clean the ink off of their equipment with giant vats of urine. So it can safely be said that I wouldn’t have made a good book designer in the 15th century.

[^2]: In [*The Machine that Made Us*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeKZlCuXyVg), a BBC documentary about Gutenberg, Stephen Fry claims that it would take about 140 calves to print a single copy of Gutenberg’s Bible. I can’t find any supporting evidence for that claim but it’s horrifying to think about nonetheless.

[^3]: The 42 line Bible was designed to be read stationary, preferably sitting down in a reading room somewhere in a monastery. The book would be placed on a large desk and the reader would be forced to sort of hunch over the text.

[^4]: Alix Christie in [*Gutenberg’s Bible*](http://www.gutenbergsapprentice.com/gutenberg-bible/): *“Though celebrated in 15th century oral histories as the undisputed inventor of printing with movable type, Gutenberg never signed his name to a single printed book. Although his early years are well documented, virtually nothing is known of his activity in the crucial years between 1449 and 1454 — the years in which the Bible of 42 lines was produced in a workshop in Mainz.”*

[^5]: Keith Houston on Gutenberg in [The Prints and the Pauper](http://ilovetypography.com/2016/09/02/the-prints-and-the-pauper/): *“…if Gutenberg is to be credited with anything it must be that he made it work—that aided by the comparatively economical Latin alphabet he systematically tackled each aspect of a finicky, delicate process until he had perfected it. If calligraphic ink did not meet his needs, he would look elsewhere; if embossed characters were too costly to cut individually, he would find a way to produce them in bulk; and if a firm hand was necessary to get the best impression of the printed page, he would choose tools and materials that could withstand that pressure. Johannes Gutenberg was not the father of printing so much as its midwife.”*

[^6]: I’m glossing over much of the type design and printing process here but I think it’s safe to say that this is a relatively fair summary of Gutenberg’s contribution.

[^7]: Perhaps I’m being a little unfair. Gutenberg and his financiers most likely knew that if they experimented too much with the form of the book then they’d never receive a return on their investment. But it’s clear from the books that an unhealthy obsession with perfection led to the creation of these objects.

[^8]: This quote is from [How Aldus Manutius Saved Civilization](https://vimeo.com/144912861) by G. Scott Clemons and it’s one of my favorite talks about typography and design.

[^9]: In a letter to a friend, Aldus wrote: *“We have printed, and are now publishing, the Satires of Juvenal and Persius in a very small format, so that they may more conveniently be held in the hand and learned by heart (not to speak of being read) by everyone.”* via [I Love Typography](http://ilovetypography.com/2014/11/25/notes-first-italic/)

The use of italics is not for saving paper — see the margins in Aldus’ books and you’ll see wide margins which could’ve been reduced in order to save money. It seems that italics were made because they resembled the handwritten word and because they looked quite beautiful.

Talking about the success of Aldus Manutius is difficult work, mostly because he had a monopoly on printing Greek literature [thanks to the Venetian government](https://www.thebookdesigner.com/2010/10/typefaces-as-history-aldus-manutius-and-the-noble-bembo/).

Counterpunch by Fred Smeijers is my favourite book on this subject and perhaps my favorite book about design in general. And this is not to mention its beautiful design.

***

[^12]: This might not be entirely accurate since Manutius printed his fair share of wonderful, and costly, texts in his time. But his work was the inspiration for a press that was more than just a factory of fancy art pieces — he designed a sustainable shop that’s business was designed to spread culture as far as possible.

***

It’s easy to criticize Gutenberg. But, thanks to his work with the printing press, more than twenty million books had been printed within sixty years of his invention.

[^TK]: In *[The Humane Interface](https://www.amazon.com/Humane-Interface-Directions-Designing-Interactive/dp/0201379376)* by Jef Raskin, there’s a wonderful section where the author outlines one of the primary faults of computers: the fact that they forget. Today that might be less of an issue but with the web we can still lose data or state all the time. How often have you typed information into a form and somehow it disappears after the slightest problem occurs? This is a design flaw with the web and I believe that Progressive Web Apps go some way to mitigate these problems.

***

For a reader, performance is one of the most important metrics for whether they will read the website or leave before the page loads. It’s quite frightening that for all our standards for typesetting that exist (beauty, legibility, etc) sheer speed appears to trump them all.

[^18]: If Aldus Manutius’ mantra was *festina lente*, or *make haste slowly*, then Gutenberg’s mantra appears to be *print everything as slowly as humanly possible*.

I see that I’ve written about two male contributors to the art of typography and omitted any mention of female printshop runners. I apologize humbly for this.

> Gutenberg’s press was capable of printing only twenty sheets an hour, or one sheet every three minutes. The invention of the movable bed, about the year 1500, increased the output of the press to two hundred sheets an hour.

The Bavarian State Library and the Munich Digitization Center has archived high quality scans of [Aldus Manutius’ Aristotle](http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0004/bsb00045766/images/index.html?id=00045766&groesser=&fip=193.174.98.30&no=&seite=1). Notice the large margins, the shortened line-height,

Make sure to check out [the Aldine Greek](http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0004/bsb00045766/images/index.html?id=00045766&groesser=&fip=xsxsyztsyztseayaxdsydxseayayztsw&no=3&seite=5) typeface that adorns the book, too.

> First a metal punch for the letter is carved in reverse; this is impressed into the mold material, creating a correct image of the letter. The mold is then filled with molten metal, producing a piece of type, which once again appears reversed. When this is inked and printed on the page, the letter reads correctly.

Gutenberg was not a particularly good businessman. Example? Printing the Bible in vellum was extraordinarily expensive and it would take up to 140 calves to print a single book.

For centuries, printing was a ruthless, clandestine trade where printers refused to share information with one another. One of my favorite storu about this spy-like printing environment comes from Fred Smeijers’ excellent book [*Counterpunch*](https://hyphenpress.co.uk/products/books/978-0-907259-42-8), which is sadly now out of print.
