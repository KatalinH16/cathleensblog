In 1927, twelve months before he published his infamous manifesto on typography, the German graphic designer Jan Tschichold wrote about the relationship between design and history:

> ‘Can it really be called culture’, he asked, ‘when the woman sitting in an automobile or an aeroplane is reading a book that could have been made in the time of Goethe?’ [^1]

What’s wrong with a book made in the time of the early 19th century author and statesman Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, you might ask? Personally, I wouldn’t argue with all that much since the books made in this era were often quite the spectacle. According to Tschichold, however, books designed in the 19th century were for the people and the technology of the time; they solved problems that were entirely inapplicable to the needs of his century.

Tschichold wanted something for his own people, his own time; he wanted designers to stop copying previous generations altogether. In fact, Tschichold was obsessed with this question over the course of his life: what is of technical and visual relevance today? And how do we reflect this in the design of the interfaces around us—through type, through geometric space, and through the mediums with which we communicate? How do we avoid copying previous solutions to design problems?

You might be familiar with some of Tschichold’s answers to these questions. For instance, around the time he emigrated to London in the late 1940s he designed the original Penguin paperback books[^2].

Through this iconic material at Penguin, and his earlier work at the Bücherkreis (which I implore you to read about[^3]), it’s clear that Tschichold adored the format of the book. But he also wanted to confront it, to poke it, to challenge our preconceptions of how we should work and how these formats should work for us.

<figure class="left contain contain--large">
    <img src="/build/images/essays/new-typography/penguin.png" alt="An image of the Penguin book cover design">
</figure>

However, it’s difficult to say anything resolute about Tschichold’s attitude towards design since his opinions tended to shift dramatically over the course of his life. Yet I believe there is certainly an attribute, or a quality that’s stashed away in these books which clearly distinguish Tschichold’s century from Goethe’s.

It can be said that, at one point or another, Tschichold believed that *“our common, everyday book will soon show a new style, which will be distinct from previous book styles...”*[^4] He then attempted to describe how the tidal forces of technology and culture would continue to encourage great changes upon our shared graphic vocabulary; in the typefaces we employ, in the graphic shapes that we prefer. And it would only be a matter of how much time we decide to waste in fighting back against these immovable forces. Instead of resisting such cultural and technical changes, Tschichold demanded that we should be more curious and that we alter our expectations of typography and design as time passes by. This is because the boundaries, or what we might call the frontiers of our profession, are not fixed: they always lie just beyond our reach.

So lately I’ve been obsessed with Tschichold’s analogy of the woman on the plane, with his “common, everyday book” and the snark with which he aimed at poor old Goethe. And now, almost a century after Tschichold wrote his manifesto on the New Typography, I’ve started to obsess about what our own time and our own text should look like.

To begin with a discussion of the text we must first acknowledge the container. And so I feel that whenever we talk of these typographic containers, we often appear to be discussing the benefits or disadvantages of a binary state, even if we don’t like to admit it: we talk about the networked and the un-networked text. And more often than not, the dialogue around these two states is often directed towards *what we’ve lost*.

<figure class="figure--full figure--full__content">

    </div>
</figure>

> [The Manual](https://themanual.org/)

So, for instance, if we make a website then we must forego the binding and the comforts of the physical heft of the object. We discard the familiar smell of the page and the ability to have absolute, god-like typographic control. Or, alternatively, if we print a book instead... 

<figure class="figure--full figure--full__content">
<img src="/build/images/essays/new-typography/manual-book.jpg" alt="An image of the fourth edition of The Manual">
</figure>

...then we lose the ability to share the text with ease, or to point deep into the text itself. We lose all the mobility of hypertext.

And thanks to this feeling of inevitable loss whenever we choose a print or a screen-based format, many designers, developers and readers see our culture and our time as a choice between these two options:

<figure class="figure--full__content">
    <img src="/build/images/essays/new-typography/offline-online.svg"
</figure>

We dissect the media landscape into physical books on one end in order to lump websites off on the other. We love categories, we crave outlines and we need a tidy media landscape, where words such as *mobile*, *tablet* and *desktop* have comprehensive, divisible meanings. But there’s an ugly implication here: that we ought to stick to one side of this modern-day media trench or the other. We should either announce our allegiance for the pro-web or the anti-web cause, and unfortunately there’s no room for subtle arguments in between.

Although, the longer I think about this, the more I’m led to believe in something greater than these two conflicting states. I’ve begun to think of design today as not so much defined by a binary option, but instead as a spectrum or a continuum: I’m fascinated in this space *between* the networked and un-networked texts. Let me explain.

> network spectrum: readmill, ebooks etc.

With ebooks we can share the text, we can make highlights and append notes and we have a vast library that can accompany us all over the world. But that library of ours is not public, it’s not even fair to call that library *ours*. We trade our private ownership of these libraries for one with infinite shelves, fed by the pipeline of either Amazon or Apple. Neither can we send people into the text itself, like we can with a website. 

On the other hand, with the web it’s hard not to dream of a Utopian media format. It’s difficult for us not to pine over what Erasmus once described as *“a library without walls”*[^5]. And it’s easy to fall victim to the excitement of Big Data and Open Source. How is it possible to avoid the giddy sensation of text which is available to edit, share or remix as we see fit?

But not all websites are built for the web. For instance, I see Facebook as a portal into a semi-accessible intranet, rather than as a series of interwoven public hypertexts. And that’s ok, too.

So I think the question that we need to ask ourselves, in our own time, in our own culture, is this: where upon this line do we make our stand? Where about on this spectrum should we define our allegiance? In fact, we don’t necessarily have to pick a side as if we’re preparing ourselves for battle, but I think we need to at least acknowledge that the current landscape is far more complicated than we’d like to admit: we have to acknowledge the subtlety of this continuum in our work.

Before I go on, I want to clearly state any bias that I might have, so let me clarify: I don’t have as much empathy for screens as much as I do the networks that make these screens worth having. Slowly, over time, I’ve recognised that I’m a ‘Web designer’ with a capital W; I believe that something happens to information and technology, and even typography itself, when people pass through these interconnected networks and interact with hypertext. And I’ve found that *web typography* creates problems that designers have to mitigate, but it also gives us opportunities that were never before possible.

It’s for these reasons that I don’t believe in “digital design” or “designing for screens” and it’s why I’m often attracted to one particular side of this spectrum. Of course, I don’t mean to say that there’s anything necessarily wrong with any other point along this spectrum, with the design of un-networked, or closed, platforms such as the Kindle or iBooks ecosystems. 

Each has surely improved over time—the Kindle’s typography for instance has developed substantially since its original launch, and iBooks has become a little less gaudy. In other developments there is Goodreads and Oyster, but Readmill is dead. iPad apps are no longer the saviour that they pretended to be and the `.pdf` format appears to be waning in popularity.

But really, it’s not the typography or the design of these digital platforms and formats that unnerve me as they once surely did. It’s because the more that I stare at and see the world through them, the more I begin to find someone staring back at me through the glass. A face reveals itself from these partly-connected, intranet-like platforms and self-contained applications where links are non-existent and file formats are often used to control people’s behaviour rather than to preserve or honour the integrity of the text.

<figure class="left">
    <img src="/build/images/essays/new-typography/goethe-kindle.jpg" alt="The ghost of Goethe">
</figure>

It won’t take long for me to see an outline of this weathered face, as soon enough I’ll begin to see poor old Goethe, emerging from the screen. What I mean to say is that I don’t see enough of the network in these things. And that makes me sad. 

> pic: offline/online spectrum with colour

I want to recognise our culture and our time in a long line of other cultures and other times, much like Tschichold. So today, although I acknowledge all the opportunities available to us along this spectrum of networktivity, I really just want to explore what happens way out at the furthest edge where the network is strongest. I’m interested in what happens to typography, or the mechanical process of setting letters into legible text, when we design interfaces on top of flimsy networks and unpredictable browsing environments. I think these technical implications have drastic consequences on how designers and developers ought to see the art of typography itself.

But before I go any further I think it’s important to take a step back and return to this gentleman for a moment: I want to talk a little bit more about Johannes, Ivan and Jan.

<figure>
    <img src="/build/images/essays/new-typography/late-tschichold.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

In 1923, the young art student Johannes Tzschichold stumbled into his apartment in a state of almost complete terror. He had just returned from an exhibition held at the Bauhaus design school in Weimar, and what he found there astonished him; posters and books from modern Russian and Hungarian designers were on display and each of them represented new artistic movements, such as the design principles of the Constructivists.

This work was unlike anything the young Tzschichold had ever seen before; he found experimental ideas for setting layout mixed with the unfamiliar juxtaposition of symbol, colour and text.

> pictures of Constructivist work in early 1920s

It’s doubtful that this poster was seen by Tzschichold at the time but it was work like this that captured his imagination, as it was vastly different from the work that he had been producing. 

What’s surprising about Tzschichold’s response though, to me at least, is that despite being only 21 years old, he was already a highly experienced and talented “graphic designer“. That term certainly didn’t exist at the time, but Tzschichold lived comfortably on the salary he earned working for commercial clients, especially in the field of book design. He also designed sketches for typefaces, including this beautiful Fraktur.

> picture of JT’s type sketches

Yet regardless of his skill, there was something about all these colourful posters and books at the Bauhaus that must’ve sent shivers down Tzschichold’s spine. He began to question the styles in which he had been trained to adore. In fact, Johannes was so enamoured by all this material that he wrote letters to designers all across Europe asking them for copies of their work. Later, he would rename himself “Ivan” and simplify his surname to “Tschichold”, in honour of this underground style that had so quickly become his inspiration.

Ivan was now obsessed with machines, efficiency and engineering in typesetting. He looked back at his work and saw nothing more than the duplicity of a copy cat, mimicking the styles and used-up energy of ancient artistic movements. We can see this clear shift in his work for the Phoebus Palast theatre in 1927:

> Phoebus Palat posters

It was around this time that Tschichold began formulating his ideas for what he called the *New Typography*. These were rules for setting letters and type, but also laws for applying colours and how associations should work between graphic forms such as circles, lines and arrows. In his book of the same name, Tschichold described the goals of this movement:

> **The essence of the New Typography is clarity**. This puts it into deliberate opposition to the old typography whose aim was “beauty” and whose clarity did not attain the high level we require today. This utmost clarity is necessary today because of the manifold claims for our attention made by the extraordinary amount of print, which demands the greatest economy of expression.
- pp. 66, The New Typography, June 1928
- (Translated from University California Press, Ruari McLean 2006)

There was something wild about this movement, something entirely punk-rock which is clear to see from the format of the manifesto itself. Likewise, the examples Tschichold made in the book were radical and weird and politically charged, too.

> example of New Typography.

In *Die neue Typographie*, Tschichold was desperate to supply laws and guidelines for designers to emulate in their work. For example, an important section in the manifesto is written to support the “elemental letterforms”[^6], or what we might today call *sans-serif* letters. Tschichold believed these letterforms were in “spiritual accordance” with his time and so any other typeface choice was probably the wrong one. Although, this was a particularly difficult issue for Tschichold to reconcile with because he despised most of the sans-serif letters that were available to him at the time. He even complained in the fly-leafs of his books[^7], apologising profusely to his readers because of the lack of typographic choices that the printer made available to him.

> picture of sans-serif letters available at the time?

Other rules in this manifesto sound more like vague suggestions, such as the preferred use of photography over illustrations and the sudden, brief thrill that Tschichold had when discarding with uppercase letters altogether in the name of efficiency. Similarly, he grew to dislike how graphic material before the 20th century was predominately aligned on a central axis running through the centre of the page.

Yet during the time when Tschichold worked on some of the most famous examples of this movement, he still designed books that completely disregarded suggestions from his own manifesto; Tschichold was always the first to break his own rules. Perhaps this was thanks to the lack of demand for this New Typographic style, but I think it’s also because his rules were too specific (i.e. which graphic forms and styles were permitted) whilst also being too vague (for example, is the new typography really all that different from the old?)

> slide of JT IT JT

So, despite my love of Tschichold’s early work, I think that preparing a set of rules for typesetting in general is an impossible task because it doesn’t take into account all the nuances and subtleties that exist. But I’ve always wondered if it’s possible to set principles for typography on the web that circumnavigate the problems that can be found in Tschichold’s preachy rules. If we were to make a set of guidelines specifically for web typography then what should we include? What would be too specific or vague?

Over recent months I’ve come up with three suggestions that I think are worthy of further discussion.


### Suggestion #1
#### We need to value the text over the font, or semantics over style.

In printed material, such as in a book or a poster, the printed text and the font are one and the same; they’re right there on the object in front of you. Something peculiar happened when the act of typography became entwined with the web though, since there was now a colossal number of systems that could render the text and many of these systems couldn’t agree with one another about anything, especially when it came to typography.

On the web most fonts are not as well supported as you might think[^8]. They are excluded by one operating system, or one browser, or instead many other problems might occur, such as a new web font might fail to load for a number of arcane and unpredictable reasons. To solve some of these problems we can use what is known as a *font stack* in CSS, like so:

```css
p {
    font-family: "Tiempos Text", Georgia, serif;
}
```

If the first font is not supported by the system, or doesn’t load at all, then the browser will, in most cases, try and use the next one. Now, this is a very simple example, but I believe that we can see the core differences between a networked and un-networked text at this juncture. This single line of CSS exemplifies how web designers have such little control over essential typographic components, such as fonts, and it proves to me how splintered and fragmented our text will be experienced.

Therefore, with web typography there is inherently a separation between the *text* and the *font* because the font can, rather unpredictably, be any one of these three values, but the text will always be preserved in the markup of a document, like so:

```html
<p>This is how we write a paragraph of text with the HTML language.</p>
```

The *text* above is predictable since it will be rendered in every browser. The *font*, however, is fragile in comparison. It’s a critical point of failure for typographers to grapple with, and ultimately we must accept that preparing our typographic interfaces for failure is better than the alternative. Kenneth Ormandy described this problem when he wrote that:

> “It’s tough for a typographer like me to admit it, but on the web we have to prioritise the text, and the font, independently.”
- Kenneth Ormandy, [Efficient Web Type c. 1556](http://kennethormandy.com/journal/efficient-web-type-circa-1556)

Kenneth was riffing on the book *Combining Typefaces*[^9] in which [Tim Brown](http://nicewebtype.com) argued that typography on the web should be “centered on the principle of progressive enhancement—that a text itself is fundamentally more important than our suggestions about how it should be typeset.”

We can learn more about prioritising the text in this way by diving deeper into the murky waters of web font loading. For instance, in [my walkthrough on the subject](https://css-tricks.com/loading-web-fonts-with-the-web-font-loader/) I mentioned two of the most popular techniques. In the first approach all of the text is hidden until the font has been successfully requested—this technique is commonly known as the Flash of Invisible Text (or FOIT) for this very reason. In the second, a webpage will always show the fallback font until the fancy web font has loaded, after which it will then be switched out for the other. In this way, the browser will show a rather strange Flash of Unstyled Text (or FOUT), but the text will always be there for the reader.[^10]

> example showing FOUT and FOIT

The web developer Scott Jehl has shown[^11] that the FOIT approach caused the text in one example to be visible in 2.7s on a 3G connection whereas the FOUT approach made the text visible in 0.6s. The Flash of Unstyled Text approach is therefore much faster for the user, more robust for the network, and manages to prioritise the text over the font.

If you happen to be a typographer from any other realm then you might feel some pang of queasiness deep down in your belly, because this obviously sounds rather perverse. You might be thinking that typographers pick certain typefaces because they compliment the written word—Georgia or Verdana, as beautifully engineered as they might be, are surely incapable of dressing our precious text. So how dare we claim that the role of a typeface itself is non-essential now? Why must we limit ourselves to a grotesque smorgasbord of flashing system fonts before we reveal our pretty web fonts?

Yet this approach to font loading does not claim that at all—the instability of the network does, the unpredictability of the browsing environment happily does that for us. So, we can either feign the same level of control as print designers and ignore these technical considerations at the expense of the reader, or we can instead learn how to dance with this new web typography, what with all its quirks and clumsiness.

Thankfully though, there are ways to mitigate the flash of seeing a new web font load as it replaces the fallback typeface. For instance, it’s quite likely that our fancy web font will look larger or smaller than the fallback, but with the [`font-size-adjust`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-size-adjust/) property we can manually adjust the size of the text based on the size of the lower case letters. This will then smoothen out the transition between the two fonts, making the flash of text much less noticeable.[^12]

If you’re still feeling uncomfortable with the way in which websites present text then strap in because you’re in for a bumpy ride: the work of Zach Leatherman is likely to cause immediate fits of unease. In January, Leatherman wrote a post called [*Critical Web Fonts*](http://www.zachleat.com/web/critical-webfonts/) which outlined a new way to think about them. He argued that first we should load a tiny font file which has been subsetted, so it contains every upper and lowercase character from A-Z which, in his example, turned out to be 9kb in size. Then, we should make a separate request for the full font file (think punctuation, ligatures and other such typographic niceties), which turned out to be 25kb. Effectively the user will then see the “flash” between system font and web font much sooner and a smaller subsequent flash when the second half of the web font loads.

Again, using the punctuation of one typeface combined with the letters of another would be considered blasphemous in print, but under such strenuous network conditions and unpredictable browsing experiences it’s clear that we must deal with these problems as best we can; it only makes sense to serve our web fonts in tiny packages. 

However, Zach expanded on this idea when he argued that not only is the font a progressive enhancement, but so are bold, italics and any other variant besides roman type. In Leatherman’s new method[^13] called the Flash of Faux Text, first the the fallback, such as Georgia, is replaced as soon as the Roman webfont is loaded. This is very similar to the FOUT approach we noticed earlier, however, instead of waiting for the web font’s bold and italic to load, Leatherman argues that it is best to mechanically fake these other variants. The browser will synthesise the regular into a fake italic and a fake bold. [^14] 

> Michael Jackson italics illustration
> [Toshi Omagari](http://tosche.net/2014/02/italic-subtleties_en.html), *Italic Subtleties*.

Once the italic and bold weights have been downloaded successfully we can then swap out the oblique and faux bold with the real web font equivalents. [^15]

Many typographers have written great screeds about these oblique and faux letterforms because they’re skewed by an algorithm, without the human eye for subtlety. And if it were print, using these faux shapes would likely be seen as an unforgivable failure, but in this case it should really be seen as a matter of pride for the web designer; we have prioritised the text before the font. In fact, I would argue that these oblique and faux letter shapes generated by the browser are a necessary evil if we want to render the text as fast as humanly possible.


### Suggestion #2
#### Understanding the consequences of graphic decisions

A cautious, uncertain balancing act exists between the art and the mechanics of setting text. This became clear to me when I started to think of web typography as a mechanical process first and foremost, and I realised the foolishness of building complex machines of text without a guide of some sort.

What I mean here is a tool that presents web designers with clear documentation for laying out text on a webpage with a list of components made up of CSS. Much has been written about these style guides and pattern libraries[^16], but what’s most interesting to me is the ways in which these tools give typographers the ability to visualise possible, latent relationships between graphic objects.

> img of Tachyons

For instance, whenever I look at the documentation of [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/docs/) and see how the padding, font size and background color of an element can be manipulated so easily, I suddenly can’t help but think that I’m perusing a modern day typecase. These ancient systems for separating and organising graphic objects have been supplanted by styleguides and pattern libraries, each showing designers what the system is capable of; they’re filled to the brim with typographic opportunities for us to exploit, and without them we are blind.

<figure>
    <img src="/build/images/essays/new-typography/typecase.jpg" alt="An image of a typecase holding 72pt Caslon Black Condensed">
</figure>

> Source: flickr.com/photos/greenplasticamy/

However, the goal of these design systems is not to permit everything imaginable. If a designer finds that they are constantly fighting the system at every turn then, either the system itself is flawed and not fit for purpose, or the designer’s mental model of the system is incomplete.

> picture of Ps/Sketch/Ai palette picker

Perhaps a better link can be made between these typographic pattern libraries and the list of available tools in Photoshop, because through these sorts of interfaces we can see all the options available to us and start to imagine how new components might come about by snapping bits of the codebase together like an elaborate typographic puzzle.

You might have noticed that this in stark contrast with Tschichold’s New Typography, where he spent a great deal of time detailing what’s *good design* in terms of visual style. But now it’s clear to me that the greatest difficult to be found on the web is in the organisation of these *hidden relationships*. We can argue about the benefits of a particular typeface until our faces turn blue, but if we ignore this complex system of relationships in CSS then I think we’re bound to stumble into much greater problems.

Simple graphic decisions can have an unexpected, even violent impact[^17] on all these subsequent parts: How do we deal with the padding between elements? What is the relationship between different headings? How can this style be broken up without the codebase turning brittle and becoming a source of confusion?[^18] How do we judge and compare these modern interfaces for typesetting? These are the sorts of questions that designers of the New Web Typography must be asking themselves if they truly want to understand the systems that they are building. 

This leads me to my final suggestion for the New Web Typography.


### Suggestion #3
#### We should acknowledge that web typography is only as strong as its weakest point.

Technological progress appears to us as a constant incline, improving year after year. The widgets and doo-dads get faster, the bumbling networks gradually become a little less bumbling.  However, the web is constantly throwing us curve balls; it has certain peculiarities and weaknesses that only reveal themselves in the fullness of time. As I mentioned previously, font loading is certainly one area where we can spot a weakness or two. But I think it’s best to group these weaknesses together so that we can best identify them: I believe that there are failures of *programming* and then there are failures of *aesthetics*.

>programming / aesthetics

First, the typographic frailties to be found in the *programming* of these design systems are most likely to be revealed inside a large, half-organised codebase, mostly made up of CSS. For example, a measure of a website’s CSS selector specificity[^19] is one instance where we can immediately identify how poorly the codebase has been organised.

> cssstas.com

This is a problem because it will likely show that somewhere in our codebase we have a selector that is far too specific. It’s either overwriting bad code that’s been written in the past or, even worse perhaps, this extra bit of code attempts to make sure that no-one can overwrite it in the future. Little bits of code like this influence the act of typography because when we set text on the web we should ideally require consistent and reliable APIs[^20] for doing so, yet this is likely to stop us dead in our tracks. If we add a class to an element, such as `.font--bold` and it doesn’t do what we expect it to, then the programmatic weakness of the system is revealing its ugly face.

Likewise, aesthetic frailty can be found when designers don’t understand how a system can be replicated with code[^21]. If there isn’t an option for designers to unfold the system before them in order to see how these components can be snapped together then, as soon as they begin to add new features to this system, they are sure to duplicate functionality or override the options that already exist.

It might be redundant to categorise the sources of typographic weakness in this way because a failure in programming will often cause a surprising failure in the aesthetics, and vice versa. Take the current implementation of declaring a `font-weight` in CSS. At the moment it’s horrendously limiting, and I think this has the effect of blinding us; we only see design on the web as consisting of regular, bold and italic variants.

Rarely do we see complex typographic interfaces on the web which consist of thin, light, book, regular, medium, bold and black weights, and for good reasons. However, these variations can often be useful in print so as to make nuanced typographic choices that lead the eye or pull the heart. Likewise, the same problem can be said for a font’s width; I sometimes wonder if we rarely see condensed or extended variants on the web because CSS has a peculiar bias against them.

I believe that these weaknesses in the programming, and the technical limitations of CSS and within the font formats themselves, has slowly become a weakness in aesthetics. Thanks to these limitations we are only able to play with a tiny slither of what many type families are capable of.

However, there are certainly interesting solutions in the works for this particular problem. In [Variable Fonts for Responsive Design](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/variable-fonts-for-responsive-design), [Nick Sherman](http://nicksherman.com/) describes a new, responsive font format for the web:

> …the glyph shapes in modern fonts are restricted to a single, static configuration. Any variation in weight, width, stroke contrast, etc.—no matter how subtle—requires separate font files. This concept may not seem so bad in the realm of print design, where layouts are also static. On the web, though, this limitation is what I refer to as the “glass floor” of responsive typography: while higher-level typographic variables like margins, line spacing, and font size can adjust dynamically to each reader’s viewing environment, that flexibility disappears for lower-level variables that are defined within the font. Each glyph is like an ice cube floating in a sea of otherwise fluid design.

This technique of generating multiple widths and weights from a “master”[^22] source is commonly referred to as interpolation[^23], which [Andrew Johnson](aetherpoint.com) shows so clearly in this demonstration:

> demo of interpolation

But why would we want this sort of flexibility on the web? Currently, loading multiple weights and widths is impractical in some cases and outright foolish in most. The ability to stretch and expand a single responsive font file would gift us with improved performance[^24], as only one font would needed to be requested, and typographic subtlety, since we could adjust the text as we see fit.

> gif of responsive font-to-width.com

A good show of this is a project called [Font to Width](http://font-to-width.com/), also made in part by Sherman, and it shows what’s possible when responsive text can adapt to its container. As each container changes shape, so does the text within it; a new font with a more suitable width replaces its predecessor in order to best fill up the space. This demo relies on a number of scripts to switch out the fonts and calculate the remaining space, but with a responsive font format we could generate a seemingly unlimited number of styles, like condensed, thin, bold and black, with only a single font file being requested instead.

Other examples[^25] of this kind might appear at first as some kind of fancy art project, suitable only for desktop wallpapers and indie museums. But I think the ingenuity of these examples are lost by many even though they reveal new methods to manipulate text, new opportunities for designers and, most interestingly, new ways of reading. Andrew Johnson has called this same technique “live font interpolation”[^26] when he claimed that:

> Live font interpolation’s context-awareness builds inherent flexibility into the font’s design. A font’s legibility and readability adjustments can be linked to accessibility options. People with low vision who increase the default text size or zoom the browser can get type optimized for them. Fonts can start to respond to combinations of factors like viewport size, screen resolution, [ambient light](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/ambient-light-events-and-javascript-detection/), screen brightness, and viewing distance. Live font interpolation offers us the ability to extend great reading experiences to everyone, regardless of how their context changes.

By stark contrast, our current implementation of the limited `font-weight` values, combined with our static fonts, appears to be a combination of programmatic *and* aesthetic frailty. And I suppose that if we can only *predict* how our text will be rendered under these strange network conditions then we can only prepare for their inevitable failure; web typography is only as strong as its weakest point. 

This begs the question: how else do we notice *weakness* in a typographic system? And how do we confront those inherent problems? 

Tschichold once saw frailty in a design as being the visual references it made to a particular time and culture that had outlived its purpose, but I see the New Web Typography has having different aspirations, which I hope to return to again and again:

1. We must value the text over the font, or semantics over style.
2. We should concern ourselves with the _consequences_ of graphic decisions, not necessarily the graphics themselves.
3. We ought to acknowledge that web typography is only as strong as its weakest point.

I suppose that these suggestions all deal with the instability I find when setting text for the web, and I only mean to remind myself of this when a new feature replaces an older one in a browser, or a new hack emerges. I want to remind myself of the technical implications of my decisions, and I want to make sure that I consider the effects of an unstable network sending an unstable codebase only to be interpreted by an unstable browsing environment. 

I hope for these ideas to act as a guide whenever I ask the question: How can be best deal with all this instability between the reader and the text?

***

Returning to Tschichold and his New Typography once more, I think it’s important to remember that it wasn’t until many years later that, as Jan Tschichold, the graphic designer would become “the most severe critic of the young Tschichold.”[^27] But I think the elderly Jan was a little too severe when looking back at the work of Ivan and Johannes. This is because I still think that the New Typography, as a movement and as a manifesto, is important for many reasons.

> img: we crave typographic laws

The first and foremost is that designers, even today, are always on the lookout for typographic laws and principles to guide them. And this makes sense because, if design is a science and not an art form, then how can there be no rule or law to help guide us? The answer to that question is complex and frustrating for every young student of design.

Like Tschichold, for a time I believed that we could very easily define what good typography is. For instance, we could say that good typography is... 

> slide of good typography is...

...surprising and charming.[^28] Or we could be a little bit more verbose and say that good typography is a well documented technical and graphic system. Subsequently, it’s said by many designers that a good paragraph of text should have a measure, or width from one side to the other, of roughly 75 characters. But what happens in scenarios when that’s entirely impossible? What do we do then?

> pic of Phone

How on earth can these devices be capable of good typography if the classical rules of typography no longer apply? I’ve always craved answers to these infuriating questions. 

At some point in 2011 I stumbled upon a guide called *On Book Design*, written by Richard Hendel,[^29] which I hoped would outline these principles. This was before I understood the complexities of design, and so I desperately craved rules which I could apply to my own work: Tell me about letter spacing, I begged this little book. Tell me which typefaces to use! For the love of all holy things, tell me how to design a book!

Hendel replied to these questions in the most frustrating way imaginable, he merely stated that “it depends” on the situation, or by the context at hand. Setting text is so deceptively complicated, Hendel reasoned, that it’s impossible to give universal orders and commands about what to do and how to go about it.[^30] In other words, design might be a science but it has no guiding light, no Principia Mathematica, no Origin of Species—there are simply too many variables, and too many problems, to list the answers themselves.

As unsettling as this was to read at the time, I soon found that almost every piece of advice about design, besides “it depends”, was a well disguised cliché of some description. And so I see the flaws in the principles that I’ve half-jokingly described here as the New Web Typography. Perhaps, one day in the near future, these networks will become so fast and so dependable that we won’t have to worry about supporting untrustworthy network conditions with strange typographic hacks. Perhaps, font files will become so small that subsetting them will sound as unfamiliar to us as `<table>` based layout appears to us today.

But for now, our fabulous networks of hypertext have been fused to our alphabet. And there is no easy way for us to separate the two, at least in the short term. Instead, we must celebrate this new form of typography because there is no stepping back from the hyperlink.[^31] And thanks to those links we have different expectations of the text itself; words are no longer the ancillaries of *reading*. Now we travel through the letters via their hyper-trans-dimensional magic, where each link forms a gateway to many greater, more elaborate, adventures.[^32]

I would not be writing here today if it was not for the many hyperlinks that lead me to you, across an ocean, across a network. But where will our text lead us next, I wonder, and how will our typography continue to adapt to these changes?

When we toggle this property we can see that the two will look proportionally similar. Unfortunately, these demos only work in the latest version of Firefox.

[^14]: I’ve made [a demo](http://codepen.io/robinrendle/pen/VedwGy) where it’s possible to compare faux italics with their real counterparts.

[^15]: I’m unsure whether this technique of subsetting fonts is applicable to all languages, just take a look at the complexity of [Vietnamese typography](https://vietnamesetypography.com) for instance.

[^16]: [styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/articles.html) is a wonderful resource by [Anna Debenham](http://maban.co.uk/) that collects the latest articles, resources and workflows for creating styleguides and pattern libraries.

[^17]: Dan Eden explains how this is possible in his excellent talk [*Move Slow and Fix Things*](http://www.thedotpost.com/2015/12/daniel-eden-move-slow-and-fix-things)

[^18]: I think one of the most under appreciated aspects of the new web typography is how we [normalise the original design](https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/normalising-designs-for-better-quality-css). *This is how the reader thinks*, says the designer. *Ah, but this is how the computer thinks*, says the developer.

[^20]: CSS is seen as a silly, broken language by many developers and so calling it an API might draw a scoff or two from certain crowds.

[^21]: This is what I was trying to explain in [*A Visual Lexicon*](https://robinrendle.com/essays/a-visual-lexicon/)

[^22]: [Multiple Master fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_master_fonts)

[^23]: [Interpolation Theory](http://www.lucasfonts.com/about/interpolation-theory), Lucas de Groot.

[^24]: Although, this is quite difficult to argue fairly without the implementation being in place to test it. This technique would certainly put all the responsibility onto the browser for manipulating the font file, rather than the network for downloading them, and so estimating the various performance bottlenecks involved with that process isn’t likely to be accurate. My argument is primarily from the standpoint of a designer and user.

[^26]: [*Live Font Interpolation on the web*](http://alistapart.com/article/live-font-interpolation-on-the-web), Andrew Johnson.

[^27]: I found this quote from [an article in McSweeneys](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/tschichold-nazis-and-allen-lane-the-modernist-politics-of-type), but there was no further attribution or source. &lt;insert rant about writers that don’t care about attribution/>

[^28]: Tschichold’s contemporary Kurt Schwitters said that: “Innumerable rules get written about typography. The most important is: never do it as someone has done it before you.” ‘Thesen über Typographie’, *Merz* no.11, 1924

[^29]: Another excellent reference for students is [Thinking with Type](http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/) by Ellen Lupton, since it focuses on typography outside the realm of book design as well. Other good references can be found in Jake Giltsoff’s [*Typography on the Web*](https://typographyontheweb.com/).

[^31]: In her essay [Hypertext for All](http://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/hypertext-for-all/), Mandy Brown reveals a lot of my biases towards text which makes me feel a little embarrassed. I remember talking to a web developer at [XOXO](http://2015.xoxofest.com/) and he mentioned that he was working on making a responsive comic book out of SVG. From his perspective the web was a tool for bombastic panels made up of heroes and big explosions and eye-popping graphics. I had to make the boring admission that I see the web as a rather simplistic tool for writing love letters out of text instead.
