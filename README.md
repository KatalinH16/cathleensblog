# [My personal website](http://robinrendle.com).
===============

## Content

Everything is written with [Writer](https://ia.net/writer/mac/) and stored in Dropbox before being copy/pasted into [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com) (eurgh). I should probably make a widget with the Siteleaf API so I can write on my own site and publish it from there.


## Workflow

- 1. `siteleaf server`
- 2. `npm start`: runs a collection of Gulp tasks.


## Typography

Typeset with [Nocturno](http://www.typonine.com/fonts/font-library/nocturno/) by [Typonine](http://www.typonine.com).
