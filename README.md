# About
This is the redesign of my personal site. It contains all the content (notes, articles and related media) including all of the front end code it runs on.

## 5 years. 60 months. 1826 days. 

That's how long this site will last.

Many redesign their website casually and on a seemingly monthly basis, rarely looking towards the future and only implementing the newest trends and techniques. Yet here I want to make something forseeably permanent; responsive to the ever-changing device landscape whilst flexible enough for me to play within the system. Is that a dumb idea? Probably, but have you ever wondered how long a digital product will last? Not just the social media and services that we use on a daily basis but their fleeting layouts, graphics, branding and general style as well?

Having a time limit (or as I like to think of it, a half-life) will force me to question every single element of the site and not just throw up a portfolio and a blog haphazardly. 

I need to raise the bar and learn more about CMSs, web standards and typographic systems, this is simply the best way to kick my ass and focus on the details that matter in the long run.

This is the bin where I threw everything in at the end of the last site. Check out the develop branch for work in progress stuff.
