# About
This is the redesign of my personal site. It contains all the content (notes, articles and related media) including all of the front end code it runs on.

## 5 years. 60 months. 1826 days. 

That's how long this site will last.

Many redesign their website casually and on a seemingly monthly basis, rarely looking towards the future and only implementing the newest trends and techniques. Yet here I want to make something forseeably permanent; responsive to the ever-changing device landscape whilst flexible enough for me to play within the system.

Having a site with a time limit (or as I like to think of it, a half-life) forces me to think through every element and not just throw together a portfolio and a blog haphazardly.
