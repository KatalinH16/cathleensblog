My personal blog and website.

## Workflow

1. Navigate to the dir and run `grunt` in the command line. This will concatenate and minify JS files as well as compile all of the Sass files.

## Typography

All fonts are served via Hoefler & Co. with titling faces set in Ideal Sans whilst running text is set in the luscious Mercury.
