This is where I work in public. 

## Setup

This project runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so all content is written in Markdown and processed by [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet). At the moment everything is published via [Siteleaf v.2](http://v2.siteleaf.com/).

CSS is preprocessed with Sass, whilst JavaScript is written in plain ES5.

All assets, including images, JavaScript and Sass files, are contained within the `_static` directory. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugins then process these files into `css`, `js` and `images` directories. You can see which plugins are installed by checking out the `package.json` file.



## Typography

The project is set with [Nocturno](http://www.typonine.com/fonts/font-library/nocturno/) Display and Text by the [Typonine](http://www.typonine.com) foundry.
