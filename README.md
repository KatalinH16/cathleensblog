My personal blog and website.

## CMS

For the moment Iâ€™m extremely happy with [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/) for editing content and quickly prototyping new ideas.

## Typography

All fonts are served via [Hoefler & Co](http://www.typography.com/), with titling faces set in [Ideal Sans](http://www.typography.com/fonts/ideal-sans/overview/) whilst running text is set in the luscious [Mercury](http://www.typography.com/fonts/mercury-text/overview/).
