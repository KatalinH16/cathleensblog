Bound up in papyrus or transcribed onto silk, the mysterious history of our books is both delightful and complex.

<p>I’ve been slowly reading <a href="http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk/books/"><em>The Book</em></a> by Keith Houston over the past fortnight, and since the author’s previous work, <em>Shady Characters</em>, is so dear to my heart I happen to feel quite guilty. I recognise that I’m doing Houston’s work an awful disservice as I pinch five minutes here and there to read it, especially because his writing is consistently light-hearted and smart.</p>

<p>The author wastes no time by jumping into the early calligraphic methods of Egyptian scribes, before moving swiftly onto the work of Cai Lun, Gutenburg’s printing press and Ottmar Mergenthaler’s Linotype machine. Along the way, Houston explores the impact of <em>proto-books</em>, like etchings on walls, or illumination in manuscripts, and explains how each of these steps towards the manufacture and design of books left their mark. But much like <em>Shady Characters</em>, I would recommend <em>The Book</em> even for those that don’t find themselves daydreaming about design or typography. </p>

<p>However, if do you happen to be typographically inclined, then this book about books has much to offer:</p>

Both inside and out, delightful flourishes illustrate the various components of a book; the head, subtitle, headcap, binding tape, drop caps, and hinge. It’s rare to find a book that compliments the subject and style of the writer so well.

In short, [*The Book*](http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk/books/)  is a delightful read and I recommend that you pick yourself up a copy as soon as you possibly can. 



## The Week in Type

Monica Dinculescu, aka [@notwaldorf](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf), made [Font style matcher](https://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/): 

> If you're using a web font, you're bound to see a flash of unstyled text (or FOUC), between the initial render of your websafe font and the webfont that you've chosen. This usually results in a jarring shift in layout, due to sizing discrepancies between the two fonts. To minimize this discrepancy, you can try to match the fallback font and the intended webfont’s x-heights and widths [1]. This tool helps you do exactly that.

The interface let’s you pick two fonts and manipulate various CSS properties to prevent that webfont loading flash from being too disruptive.

I also missed that in October [Monica made an emoji font](https://meowni.ca/posts/og-emoji-font/) based on the original emoji, released on the DoCoMo phone in 1999:

Laurence Penney made [a fascinating variable font demo](http://www.axis-praxis.org/demo.php?id=3):

Make sure to check out the demo above in a browser that supports variable fonts, like [Webkit Nightly](https://webkit.org/nightly/). Laurence also wrote more about what’s going on in [a post about the demo](http://www.axis-praxis.org/blog/2016-11-24/10/demo-resize-textbox-with-variable-fonts).

## Letter of the week

This week’s letter is the lowercase Y from Ludwig Type’s [Godfrey](https://www.ludwigtype.de/fonts/godfrey/overview):

The designer of Godfrey also built a really cool specimen website to market the typeface where you can see the typeface in more realistic scenarios:

✌️ Until next time!
