In the SOMA district of San Francisco lies a gray and stumpy building that could easily be mistaken for any other. And in the rain it took me a little while to find it. But after a brief introduction with the tour guide, we began in earnest: printing machines from the Industrial Revolution line the walls and delicately typeset placards dot around them in the gallery.

This, of course, is the American Bookbinder’s Museum.

As the name implies, the museum is dedicated to the art of printing and bookmaking in America and it’s an undisputed natural wonder. But halfway through the tour our bubbly and excitable guide of this wonderful collection, Anna, posed a question to us: “Have you ever heard about the [*Gutenberg Galaxy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy)?” she asked.

[This was the point where I couldn’t take notes fast enough, so I’m bundling a five minute conversation into this small paragraph below...]

The idea goes something like this: Thanks to the printing methods that descended from Johannes Gutenberg, the 15th century inventor of printing, it was discovered that a large set of the population were either short or far-sighted. This spurred the development of glass and, more specifically, lenses. But depending on the size or shape of the lens, scientists were able to zoom into the tiniest pinprick of a smudge to reveal a biological zoo in microbial form or they could render those flickers of light above into focus and make the infinite shape of the galaxy known.

“So!” Anna excitedly gasped. “Not only do we owe Gutenberg thanks for this delightful ability to read a book, but also for the ability to read the stars.”

However delightful that story might’ve been, the smiles began to fade when I realised that printing has always been a miserable, painful business. And that was a shocking revelation because a book will always be reminiscent to me of time-travel and hiding under the covers on a long winter’s night. But for the majority of the people that manufactured these books it was always a living nightmare of grinding metal and hazardous, dreary hours.

“And that was someone’s job,” Anna sighed as she stood up from what looked like a complex showing machine. “Eleven hours a day, six days a week, someone would sit there feeding this machine books to be sewn together.”
