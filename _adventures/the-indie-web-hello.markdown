<div class="message-body"> <div>This week I’ve been thinking a lot about maps.<br>
<br>
It began with a website that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.100yearsofnps.com/">celebrates the National Parks Act of 1872</a>, which was&nbsp;signed by President&nbsp;Ulysees S. Grant.&nbsp;This was the act that established America’s&nbsp;public parks, and the website takes a glance at how&nbsp;this policy has adapted over the past century. But, somehow, this led me to the <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/20/heres-why-national-parks-maps-are-some-of-the-best/">National Geographic</a>&nbsp;where Greg Miller writes about some of the beautiful (although often&nbsp;typographically strange)&nbsp;maps that are created by the National Park Service.<br>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="926949" height="480" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/c739cdb7-71f5-4840-a5c9-df33de51b323.jpg" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"><br>
It’s here that Greg&nbsp;talks with&nbsp;Tom Patterson, the senior cartographer:</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<em>Another feature that distinguishes park service maps is their use of shaded relief to give the maps a 3-dimensional look. This method—using shading to simulate the shadows cast by hills and other features of the terrain—is Patterson’s specialty. He’s invented several techniques for doing shaded relief and even writes<a href="http://www.shadedrelief.com/"> a blog about it.</a></em></div>

<div><br>
Oh boy. Prepare yourself before you click that link:&nbsp;Tom’s blog is so impossibly cute in a web-master-circa-1997-sort-of-way that I couldn’t help but take a closer look.&nbsp;Yet it was here that I found he had made his own map: the Patterson projection!<br>
<br>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="926917" height="365" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/a7191f25-57b3-4019-923d-9a9a7323df9d.jpeg" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"><br>
I don’t really know what excites me about this so much, and I certainly don’t know enough about maps to say what problems or advantages the Patterson projection has over the more familiar types, such as the Mercator projection. I guess I’m excited because the act of&nbsp;making&nbsp;a projection and putting it on your blog&nbsp;is something that anyone, from anywhere,&nbsp;can do. It’s so&nbsp;punk rock. It’s so Web.<br>
<br>
Even&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shadedrelief.com/home_extras/">Patterson’s profile image</a> is eminently&nbsp;charming: he stares up from below, waving his hand and smiling his goofy dad smile&nbsp;to any fellow map-projectionist&nbsp;that happens&nbsp;to have stumbled onto his portion of the internet.&nbsp;This gesture should be familiar to anyone that’s spent a lot of time reading blogs like Tom’s: this is&nbsp;the <strong>Indie Web Hello</strong>. You don’t need any degrees or expertise to be welcome, all you need is curiosity and a web browser.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this kind of activity is something I’ve been noticing more and more over the past couple of years; whilst Monotype has been buying up the type industry, foundry by foundry, there appears to be a collective of indie type designers working for themselves. These are folks that sell fonts on their blog, fonts that took them years to make, and they’re just designing for themselves on a project that they adore. I’m not sure if I’d call it a renaissance or a resurgence or what-have-you just yet, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about as I poke around the <a href="http://www.typenetwork.com/">Type Network</a>.<br>
<br>
Anyway anyway,&nbsp;I want to see more independent&nbsp;type designers and tiny foundries that are working for themselves because I think that makes the typographic&nbsp;micro-economy healthy and more interesting, but also since these groups&nbsp;change&nbsp;the language around type. And this is something that desperately needs to change, especially in web design:&nbsp;for students and novices,&nbsp;typography is shrouded in vocabulary and snark, and&nbsp;there is a&nbsp;feeling I remember as a student where I believed only&nbsp;the elect few could work with letters. The rest were merely amateurs or fools.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Well, I want to be one of the amateurs. I want to be more like Tom and welcome new designers into the fray. And so hello! This is <em>Adventures in Typography</em>, a sometimes-weekly newsletter about type, and I am writing from San Francisco&nbsp;to greet you with my&nbsp;Indie Web Hello.</div>

The Week in Type</h2>

<p>Over on I Love Typography, Jasper De Waard has written about <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2016/07/14/making-fonts-proza-libre/">the design of Proza Libre</a>, which is now available on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Proza+Libre">Google Fonts</a>.<br>

María Ramos wrote about <a href="http://typographica.org/on-typography/typewriter-typeface-the-legacy-of-the-writing-machine-in-type-design/">the difference between a “typewriter” and “monospaced” typeface</a> for Typographica:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Typefaces created for typewriters were designed with the limitations of the machine in mind. Despite the variety of styles created, most typefaces shared certain features. To fulfill the monospace need of mechanical models, letters sometimes adopted different shapes from printing type: for instance, the ‘J’ with a large tail aligned with the baseline; the ‘W’ and ‘M’ with a shorter middle joint; or the ‘t’ with a long curved bottom ending. The ink spread caused by the transfer printing method demanded large countershapes and a generous x-height. It was also very difficult to print high-contrast characters and sharp outlines with transfer printing. In typewritten documents, the corners and joints between strokes took on a rounded and irregular appearance. This led designers to create rather monolinear designs to get a more predictable result.</p>

María also links to <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2015/10/new-fangled-writing-machine.html">a fine Letters of Note entry</a> where Samuel Clemens, aka Mark Twain, wrote about his typewriter (which could only print in all caps):

<blockquote>
<p>I AM TRYING T TO GET THE HANG OF THIS NEW F FANGLED WRITING MACHINE, BUT AM NOT MAKING A SHINING SUCCESS OF IT. HOWEVER THIS IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT I EVER HAVE MADE, &amp; YET I PERCEIVE THAT I SHALL SOON &amp; EASILY ACQUIRE A FINE FACILITY IN ITS USE.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/grillitype/status/752549624536297472">Grilli Type Foundry asked type designers</a> which typeface released in the last ten years they wish they had designed.<br>

Indra Kupferschmid, over on&nbsp;Alphabettes, collected <a href="http://www.alphabettes.org/alphabettes-news-february-june/">some of the excellent work</a> that’s been done so far this year by members of the group.<br>

And finally, Tobias Frere-Jones gave an excellent talk about <a href="http://99u.com/videos/53989/tobias-frere-jones-break-things-deliberately">why we need more typefaces</a> and why designers need to collect things.<br>

<h2>Letter of the Week</h2>
I’ve been oogling over <a href="http://www.contrastfoundry.com/portfolio/chimera">Chimera</a> by the Contrast type foundry lately and trying to find a good use for it in a project or two. This week I will be cheating however, because I want to covet multiple styles of Chimera’s lowercase 'a'.<br>
