<p>This week it <a href="https://twitter.com/vruba/status/786964172428816384">rained</a> in San Francisco. It’s been almost five months of unadulterated sunshine and so I’m a little wistful of England, where a week of summer would interrupt an otherwise casual storm that lasts all year. Yet, besides the rain, these wistful reveries flare up whenever my thoughts turn to the five thousand miles of American continent and Atlantic ocean that sit between my library and me; it must be said that I left my books behind in a hurry. I locked them up in a series of cardboard boxes and hurled them all into a storage container before I boarded a one way flight. Now, they lie dormant beneath the everlasting raincloud I think of as <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>I suppose, yes, I am a little homesick. But only since I can’t adequately describe the joy of wasting away a Sunday afternoon in front of my shelves, pouring over old notes that I scribbled in the margins many years ago; seeing the cogs churn in my young mind; watching one book lead to the next; wondering whether it was this footnote or that thread which marked an adventure through a series of books that I would read throughout that year. One page after another and another; flipping through a novel in which the plot suddenly gathers pace and my notes respond in kind, scribbly organisms of discontent and curiosity, all of which build into an obsession with the author over time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I won’t feel at home on this new continent, or at least I certainly won’t settle, until my library is with me, too. But in the mean time, a new library emerges; books I’ve gathered from all across the Bay Area. Unfortunately these are not books on the subject of typography, although they are typographic in nature.</p>

My favourite of the bunch has been Jeff Vandermeer’s sci-fi *Southern Reach* trilogy. The novel takes place in and around a mysterious plot of land called Area X, and very much like the landscape that the novels portray, the books themselves tend to have alien characteristics, too. Take, for example, the copy I picked up a couple of weeks ago with cover design by [Rodrigo Corral](http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2015/01/21/rodrigo-corrals-cover-area-x-hardcover/):

The copy of Area X above is a collection of the three novels in the series; *Annihilation*, *Authority* and *Acceptance*. Each novel has an animal companion that dominates the story in one way or another and this is more prominent in the editions published by FSG and illustrated by [Eric Nyquist](http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2014/05/02/eric-nyquist-and-the-southern-reach-series/), designed by Charlotte Strick and with animations below produced by Emily Bouman:

On the other hand, Pablo Delcán’s version takes a darker and more surreal approach. In fact, [Jeff Vandermeer interviewed Pablo](http://www.fsgworkinprogress.com/2014/06/foreign-editions-the-southern-reach-trilogy) and in a separate article discussed [the origins of the series](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/from-annihilation-to-acceptance-a-writers-surreal-journey/384884/):

> These covers were an exercise of appropriation, the most important part was finding these images. The plant comes from an illustration of a *Fritillaria imperialis* beautifully drawn by Pierre-Joseph Redouté in the early eighteen hundreds, the hare and the owl are Audubon engravings

These images were then edited to create this chilling effect of animals and plant matter being stretched into monsters. But not each and every edition is as gloomy as the others, for instance the UK edition in particular masks a lot of the strangeness of the books’ innards:

The collection above makes Vandermeer’s work look more serene and *Alice in Wonderland*-esque and I wonder how that might effect one’s reading of the books themselves.

There’s something quite delightful about the idea that the novelist can entertain three loose themes for a series—dragonfly, rabbit, owl—only for them to be constantly reimagined by the audience. 

All of this makes me think back to my library across that vast expanse and I wonder how many books I would like to buy again in duplicate, multiple copies in different languages and styles, alternative bindings and artists that adorn and reshape the meaning of the text inside. Consequently that thought leads me to worry about the future of my second transatlantic library because which of those books across the ocean led me here? Which book brought me to San Francisco? What would’ve happened if I didn’t buy a particular book in a certain format, under just the right conditions? 

Perhaps if I left out one book out of this great chain of books then I wouldn’t be sitting in my comfortable apartment now, listening to my neighbour’s wind chimes across the street and the pitter-patter of children’s laughter as they walk to school.

## The Week in Type

First, the [great flowering](https://www.robinrendle.com/adventures/a-great-flowering/) has begun! Over the past couple of weeks variable font demos have been starting to appear in the wild. I think it started with [Chris Lewis experimenting with them](https://twitter.com/chrissam42/status/778716592049795075) in Windows 10:
