<p>This week it <a href="https://twitter.com/vruba/status/786964172428816384">rained</a> in San Francisco. It’s been almost five months of unadulterated sunshine over here and so I’m a little wistful of England, where a week of summer would interrupt an otherwise casual storm that lasts all year.</p>

<p>Besides the rain, these wistful reveries flare up whenever my thoughts turn to the five thousand miles of American continent and Atlantic ocean that sit between my library and me; it must be said that I left my books behind in a hurry. I locked them up in a series of cardboard boxes and hurled them all into a storage container before I hopped on the plane. Now, they lie dormant beneath the everlasting raincloud I think of as <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>I suppose, yes, I am a little homesick. But only since I can’t adequately describe the joy of blowing through a Sunday afternoon in front of my shelves, pouring over old notes that I scribbled in the margins many years ago; seeing the cogs churn in my young mind; watching one book led to the next; wondering whether it was this footnote or that thread which marked an adventure through a series of books that I would read throughout that year. One page after another and another; flipping through a novel in which the plot suddenly gathers pace and my notes respond in kind, scribbly organisms of discontent and curiosity, all of which build into an obsession with the author over time.</p>

<p>But which book led me here, I wonder. Which book brought me to San Francisco?</p>

<p>Anyway, I won’t feel at home on this new continent, or at least I certainly won’t settle, until my library is with me, too. But in the mean time, a new library emerges; books I’ve gathered from all across the Bay Area. Unfortunately these are not books on the subject of typography, although they certainly are typographic.</p>

<p>My favourite of the bunch has been Jeff Vandermeer’s sci-fi <em>Southern Reach</em> trilogy. The novel takes place in and around a mysterious plot of land called Area X, and very much like the landscape that the novels portray, the books themselves tend to have certain alien characteristics.</p>

Take, for example, the copy I picked up a couple of weeks ago with cover design by [Rodrigo Corral](http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2015/01/21/rodrigo-corrals-cover-area-x-hardcover/):

<p>And compare that to the covers by Eric Nyquist: </p>

<p>And also the North American edition published by FSG and designed by <a href="http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2014/05/02/eric-nyquist-and-the-southern-reach-series/">Eric Nyquist</a>:</p>
