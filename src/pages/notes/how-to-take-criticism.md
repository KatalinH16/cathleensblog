I love this piece by Chappell Ellison so much; she looks at [design criticism from a different point of view](http://chappellellison.com/giving-and-taking-criticism):

> Universities teach you how to give criticism. They’ve been doing it for centuries. They supply all sorts of texts so that you can cough up fancy words and names to support your argument.
>
> But the thing is, no one teaches you how to take criticism. This is ridiculous. It’s like teaching construction workers about nuts and not bolts.
>
> As it turns out, it’s really hard to teach people how to take criticism.
>
> That’s because everyone is human and naturally defensive and very sensitive and we all have a secret emotional space where we’re in a constant state of LOL/#RIP and we’re all maybe dying a little inside but that’s okay here’s a gif of cat dressed as a pirate.
