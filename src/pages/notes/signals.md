It’s so very strange when you’ve been talking to someone for 6 months and then, suddenly, from nothing but a quick look, you can _see_ how they feel. You've spent so much time with them that they can’t hide anything from you; all their tells are now revealed. Language takes a back seat and you can read so much more in the quiet moments, or from their body language, or from where they put a comma more so than the words they use.

What does it mean when she blinks a few times in a row? What does that little smirk mean? What about that? And THAT? I would think to myself early on.

But now? _YIKES_. I've never talked to this person in real life before—shut up—but I have this impossibly accurate spidey sense as to how they'll react to something, and what all the signals mean.

And how I might help.
