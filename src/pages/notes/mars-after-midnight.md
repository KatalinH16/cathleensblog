[Lucas Pope](https://dukope.com/) has been writing intermittently about the development of his new game, [Mars After Midnight](https://dukope.itch.io/mars-after-midnight/devlog/285964/working-in-one-bit): 

> Working in 1-bit for this game has been interesting. Going in, I thought my experience with Obra Dinn would let me cruise through the visuals. Typical devlog setup, so let me describe in detail how wrong that thought was.

> Turns out that rendering 3D content in grayscale with realtime post-processing to 1-bit is a totally different thing from making well-crafted 2D art. Most of my existing skillset and pipeline has been almost useless.

Look at [how Lucas generated the faces of each monster](https://dukope.itch.io/mars-after-midnight/devlog/263965/making-martian-faces), too! There’s powerful blogging-whilst-working energy here. And I’m just so excited about this new game for the Playdate since [_Return of the Obra Dinn_](https://obradinn.com/) is one of my favorite games of all time.
