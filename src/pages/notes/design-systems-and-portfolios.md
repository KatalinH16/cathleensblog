I wrote up some opinions I have about [design systems and portfolios](https://css-tricks.com/design-systems-and-portfolios/) for CSS-Tricks:

> In my experience working with design systems, I’ve found that I have to sacrifice my portfolio to do it well. Unlike a lot of other design work where it’s relatively easy to present Dribbble-worthy interfaces and designs, I fear that systems are quite a bit trickier than that.

> You could make things beautiful, but the best work that happens on a design systems team often isn’t beautiful. In fact, a lot of the best work isn’t even _visible_.

[Jennie Yip replied](https://twitter.com/jenniesyip/status/1106731290122813440) and mentioned that there is a way to show design systems work in a portfolio, pointing to [the lovely work of Jocelyn Wong](https://jocelyn-wong.com/project-modal-component.html). But I guess maybe my point got lost in the rant a little.

What I was trying to say in that post is that making beautiful things is, quite frankly, easier than making a beautiful system – and to do that well you often have to sacrifice or compromise the beauty of this one component or this one project for the overall harmony of the system.

I mentioned to one of our designers today that certain parts of our UI are at war with one another – or that perhaps our entire design team is in a stalemate where our weapons are drawn and are at eachother’s throats. Cards and alerts, illustrations and animations – we use these to hijack attention but this increases the stakes for everyone else on the team. Now to get their UI noticed they have to escalate things even further – bolder text, bigger animations, kaboom!

The goal of a design systems team is to reduce the stalemate, to stop the civil war that’s quietly raging inside an organization. And to do that they must sacrifice their portfolio by [making things boring](http://blog.capwatkins.com/the-boring-designer).
