extract: "The lost play of Sophocles. "

Alberto Manguel in _The Library at Night_:

> One of the lost plays of Sophocles is _The Loves of Achilles_, copies of which must have perished one after another, century after century, destroyed in pillaging and fires or excluded from library catalogues because perhaps the librarian deemed the play of little interest or of poor literary quality. A few words were, however, miraculously preserved. "In the Dark Ages, in Macedonia," Tom Stoppard has one of his characters explain in his play _The Invention of Love_, "in the last guttering light from classical antiquity, a man copied out bits from old books for his young son, whose name was Septimius; so we have one sentence from _The Loves of Achilles_. Love, said Sophocles, feels like the ice held in the hand by children."
