I love this piece by Steve Klabnik on [how to care for an open source community](https://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener). He writes:

> ...without someone actively paying attention, it’s only a matter of time before things get unseemly. If you’re looking to help out an open source project, it’s not a glamorous job, but all it takes is a little bit of work, and developing a habit.

There’s a lot in here that I think relates to design systems work where the job is about being meticulous in very peculiar ways (whenever I start a project now I’ll always squint at it from every angle to try and figure out if it needs a spreadsheet or not).
