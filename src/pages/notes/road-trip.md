I took a little time off last week and for a couple of days I headed up to Oregon on my bike. Together we drove through swooping valleys and up into snow-capped mountains, around twisty rock faces and great empty plains; every moment was thoroughly breathtaking. Although I didnâ€™t take pictures of the most memorable moments, here are some of the highlights that I did manage to snap:
