Hereâ€™s a real interesting piece about [gifts and software](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20211229):

> Not every project on github is the same. Not everyone has the same motivations. Giving them money won't change their motivations. Trying to pay them or regulate them taints the gift. If you wanted to pay someone to fix some software, you didn't want a gift. You wanted a company. 
> 
> But if there is no company and someone gave you something anyway? Say thanks.
