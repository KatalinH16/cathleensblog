William Weaver, the translator of many of Calvino’s books, [wrote this great piece](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2027/the-art-of-fiction-no-130-italo-calvino) about his relationship with the author:

> Writers do not necessarily cherish their translators, and I occasionally had the feeling that Calvino would have preferred to translate his books himself. In later years he liked to see the galleys of the translation; he would make changes—in his English. The changes were not necessarily corrections of the translation; more often they were revisions, alterations of his own text. Calvino’s English was more theoretical than idiomatic. He also had a way of falling in love with foreign words. With the _Mr. Palomar_ translation he developed a crush on the word _feedback_. He kept inserting it in the text and I kept tactfully removing it. I couldn’t make it clear to him that, like _charisma_ and _input_ and _bottom line_, _feedback_, however beautiful it may sound to the Italian ear, was not appropriate in an English-language literary work.
