  "“Do you mind if I tell you, while I have your ear? All of this, the funeral,
  the family, the sudden reminder that life ends, it makes me realize how ignorant
  I am. I'm so sure I'm clever and sophisticated, a smug little agnostic, but put
  me face forward with death, and I don't know my right from my north...”"

I’ve been going back through [Ftrain](http://ftrain.com) thanks to [Paul Ford’s talk at XOXO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSL5qVL3Mng), and there’s a wondrous archive bundled up in this old site of his—years and years of journal entries. [This post](http://www.ftrain.com/archive_ftrainone_920607237.html) about his grandfather’s funeral is particularly eye-popping:

> Do you mind if I tell you, while I have your ear? All of this, the funeral, the family, the sudden reminder that life ends, it makes me realize how ignorant I am. I'm so sure I'm clever and sophisticated, a smug little agnostic, but put me face forward with death, and I don't know my right from my north. All the rules for social interaction, all the solid clues and codes and handshakes sublimate into the air. Well-written proposals, a steady paycheck, making rent, building the next generation of web sites--these things don't hold up next to death. Death blows them over like a hurricane through a shantytown.

In the talk, Paul also mentions a poem by the 13th century Persian poet [Jelaluddin Rumi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi) called the _Guest House_. It feels somewhat complimentary to what Paul wrote above:

<blockquote><p><em>This being human is a guest house.<br>
Every morning a new arrival.</em></p>

<p><em>A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br>
some momentary awareness comes<br>
as an unexpected visitor.</em></p>

<p><em>Welcome and entertain them all!<br>
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br>
who violently sweep your house<br>
empty of its furniture,<br>
still, treat each guest honorably.<br>
He may be clearing you out<br>
for some new delight.</em></p>

<p><em>The dark thought, the shame, the malice<br>
meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.</em></p>

<p><em>Be grateful for whatever comes</br>
because each has been sent<br>
as a guide from beyond.</em></p></blockquote>
