Lovely work from Alisa Burzic here called [36 Days of Type](https://twitter.com/burzic_alisa/status/1502907342144548866); once a day she makes a beautiful letter and although right now it’s just a bunch of tweets, it would be so cool to see [each](https://twitter.com/burzic_alisa/status/1500823324389163018) [of](https://twitter.com/burzic_alisa/status/1501199799097376770) [these](https://twitter.com/burzic_alisa/status/1501513430662107136) in a big scrolly website. Each of these letterforms are weird alien fun. 

Oh! I didn’t realize that this was like the 100 day projects I see on the web every once in a while. Lots of folks are making their own letters and each of them are [bananas](https://twitter.com/hashtag/36daysoftype?src=hashtag_click).
