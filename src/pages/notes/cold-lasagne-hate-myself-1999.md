This standup special by James Acaster called [Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/coldlasagne) is not only the funniest show I’ve seen in a long time but also has the best explanation of Brexit I’ve ever heard.

If you’ve never heard of James before (he’s very popular in the UK) then you should absolutely check out [Repertoire](https://www.netflix.com/title/80213803) on Netflix; it’s 4 comedy specials back to back and I devoured them all in one night. It’s so impossibly good it makes me angry.
