I wrote an email to Lucy over the weekend all about, well, [email and the web](https://world.hey.com/robin.rendle/everyone-in-the-world-is-just-an-email-away-a1eff400):

> Anyway, I see HTML and CSS as a bridge—a set of languages and agreements between browsers that give us access to nigh-on everyone in the world. (And I think that’s a neat way to see publishing in general, actually. Publish a thing and suddenly you have access to more ideas and weirder friends, rather than just simply acquiring a handful of retweets and a bunch of $).

> Anyway anyway, I’m typing at you now from my inbox which is then being published as a blog post via Hey World—once I hit send it’ll be catapulted out into the ether for everyone to read. Isn’t that exciting? Even our inboxes are publishing platforms now. And sure, Hey is a commercial product, but what this suggests to me is that we haven’t even come close to figuring out the web yet.
