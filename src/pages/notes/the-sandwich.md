“So I sat there,” he said. 

“And I thought to myself, ya know, ‘ruthless honesty’ and all that. This guy sold me a terrible sandwich and I’m going to tell him just how terrible it was. But then he was upset when I told him! He made this shitty, awful sandwich—which I paid money for—and when he asked me how it was, what was I supposed to tell him? What did he think I was going to say! I said it was just awful. The worst sandwich I’ve ever had. He got upset! So I told him, if you don’t want the truth—don’t ask.”

A long pause. No one laughed. Someone eventually coughed. The silence after that tirade was so embarrassing that it was funny. I tried to imagine what the teller of this tale expected from us. Did he expect us to laugh? Or for everyone on the video call to jump onto the poor shop owner and belittle that sandwich, too? Maybe he thought we were going to be impressed by his high standards? Or the sheer courage he had to look someone in the eye and tell them and their bad sandwich to fuck right off.

No one, I must say, was impressed.

For months I’ve thought about this conversation and all the ways I might’ve said something similar in the past. All the ways I’ve been small and petty. It’s such an insignificant thing to point at, or to write about, but these little acts of meanness are no less painful because they’re common. But to then brag about the story afterwards? 

Sweet, I must say, _Christ_.

But it’s the kind of cruelty that we let go. It’s really difficult to confront shitty, toxic behavior like this because 1. the person will absolutely not change whatsoever and 2. to obsess over a story like this seems like a waste of time. To push back on small things like this sounds like _you’re_ the one being petty.

It’s these small details, these are the things to watch out for in people. Because I believe deep down in my gut that intelligence isn’t enough. I really don’t care how well you know flexbox or how many beautiful typefaces you’ve made, because if you are an asshole then that’s the ballgame. 

You don’t have license to be an enormous, raging bastard if you’re smart, or if you’re good enough at your job, or even if you’re rich. Here in the Bay Area tech scene, I think that this the worst thing people took from a certain bespectacled, turtle-necked gentleman—they don’t quite get that he was good at his job _despite_ being an absolute bastard. But we can all aspire to be better than the turtle neck guy. 

Because here’s the thing that’s impossible to teach (and extremely difficult to learn): _kindness_ is the only kind of intelligence that counts.
