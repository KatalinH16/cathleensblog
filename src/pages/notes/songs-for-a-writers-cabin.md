Cabin is my work buddy. My meditation buddy. My focus buddy. Cabin is a Spotify playlist that I’ve been adding songs to for a very long time now and it has almost ten hours of music to help me get work done.

Pretty much everything I’ve ever published and every line of code I’ve ever written has been typed whilst listening to this playlist of mostly instrumental melodies. Hopefully you might find it just as soothing and creepy and wonderful, too:
