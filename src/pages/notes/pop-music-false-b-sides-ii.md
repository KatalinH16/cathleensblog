extract: The latest album from Baths.

Baths released a new album called _Pop Music / False B-Sides II_ and Iâ€™ve been listening to it non-stop this week. My favorite song at the moment is [Sex](https://open.spotify.com/track/4VQPuTO98JrKBvcsj60izm?si=WGAQCVWQS3uiXhlhQdtfFQ) because the moment I hit play it drags me screaming back to my college dorm when I listened to Baths for the very first time.

I find myself today in a similar place as I was back then; stuck in place, reminiscing about everything with enormous doses of nostalgia, my life held on pause with endless waiting, alone but almost, maybe, intermittently happy. Baths nails that feeling, of being happy sad, saddily happy, joyously miserable.
