C bought a typewriter and hid it in her car. Each week sheâ€™d drive out to her parentsâ€™ house without telling me and under this veil of secrecy sheâ€™d type out little secrets on little cards. On each of them sheâ€™d write a joke, a memory, a secret about a secret that weâ€™d told each other over the past year.

On my birthday I entered the kitchen and found myself surrounded by balloons and cake and hugs. C then handed me a bookâ€”it was a collection of all those tiny cards bound together. A book of secrets.

Later (after a brief, hour-long period where I absolutely did not cry and you cannot prove that I ever did) I asked where she hid everything. Where were the balloons and the cake? I was at home working the whole time and barely left at all. Where did you make this little book? 

In the most C way imaginable, she just said ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€.

Ever since my birthday I walk through the hallways of this house and I think about all the other gifts; those hidden in every corner of our house. There must be a present in each closet, above us in each ceiling, and under every floorboard beneath us. We are surrounded by gifts.  

I canâ€™t stop smiling as I walk through this house of secret presents because I know what my job is: add more to the collection. Build a bigger house of lovely secrets.
