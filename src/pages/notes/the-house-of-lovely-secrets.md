C bought a typewriter and hid it in her car. Each week sheâ€™d drive out to her parentsâ€™ house without telling me and, under this veil of secrecy, sheâ€™d type out messages on little cards. On each of card sheâ€™d write a joke, a memory, a secret about a secret that weâ€™d told each other over the past year.

On my birthday I entered the kitchen and found myself surrounded by balloons and cakes and hugs. C then handed me a bookâ€”it was a collection of all those cards bound together. A book of secrets.

Laterâ€”after a brief, hour-long period where I absolutely did not cry and you cannot prove that I ever didâ€”I asked where she hid everything. Where were the balloons and the cake? I was at home working the whole time and barely left at all. Where did you make this book? 

In the most C way imaginable, she just said ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€.

So now, ever since my birthday, as I walk through the hallways of this house I think about all the other gifts, those hidden in every corner of our home; in the closets and cabinets, above us in the ceiling, and in the floorboards beneath. Weâ€™re surrounded by gifts.

I canâ€™t stop smiling as I walk through this house now, because I know what my job is: add more to the collection. Build a bigger house of lovely secrets and hidden gifts.
