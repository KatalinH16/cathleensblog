For the CSS-Tricks newsletter, I wrote a bit about [all the weird browsers](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/273-weird-browsers/) I’ve been seeing lately:

> ...it feels like there’s something in the air when it comes to browsers. Folks are starting to think about them differently and that’s exciting. And although in the front-end world we’re constantly bemoaning the convergence of browsers towards Chrome and WebKit—and for good reason, too (ideally we’d have both browser engine and UI diversity). But I think that this can sometimes be a little short-sighted because UI diversity is just as important, perhaps.

I’m _excited_ about all this.
