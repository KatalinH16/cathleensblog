extract: And the design behind Retail.

One thing I love about [Retail](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/retail) by OhNo Type Co. is that the type specimen is sort of like an essay. As you scroll through and see each of the designs for the bold, the thin, and the display styles, you also get a story about the design of the type family.

Also, I love the design of Retail and this lil snippet:

> The designers here at Ohno enjoy taking a well-trodden genre, and amplifying what we love about it. Retail is the result of focussing our energy on the not-too-trendy world of humanist sans. What makes a humanist sans human-like? I think it comes down to seeing some evidence of the hand, some evidence of a pen, and little bit of warmth mixed in.
