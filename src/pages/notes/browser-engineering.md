I’ve only just started this excellent book called [browser.engineering](https://browser.engineering) but it’s already so dang good that I have to stop reading it in order to quote this sectionL:

> The web is a grand, crazy experiment. It’s natural, nowadays, to watch videos, read news, and connect with friends on the web. That can make the web seem simple and obvious, finished, already built. But the web is neither simple nor obvious. It is the result of experiments and research reaching back to nearly the beginning of computing.
> 
> [...] The key thing to understand is this grand experiment is not over. The essence of the web will stay, but by studying web browsers you have the chance to contribute and to shape its future.

I am so thoroughly excited about this webbish book about the web. Now, where was I? Ah yes, back to reading.
