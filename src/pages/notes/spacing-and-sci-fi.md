Rutherford Craze on [the design of MD Nichrome](https://www.mass-driver.com/article/md-nichrome-on-spacing-and-sci-fi): 

> …something I think about a lot in my work is the idea of the technology gap. When a creative work moves from one medium to another, not every part of it survives the transition: the digital version of a typeface originally cut in metal is an imperfect replica, just as a film is never the same as the book it was based on — and for much the same reason: the work must be re-made to fit a fundamentally different medium.

Dang, I love the idea of adding serifs to MD Nichrome. This is such a great piece.
