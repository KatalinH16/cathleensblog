David Foster Wallace wrote a wonderful piece on [the campaign trail](https://kottke.org/18/04/david-foster-wallace-on-john-mccains-2000-presidential-campaign) of John McCain back in 2000 but my favorite part is where he describes how we’ve been hurt by politics. And subsequently, how that creates a palpable sense of listlessness and ennui in all of us (via [Kottke](https://kottke.org/18/04/david-foster-wallace-on-john-mccains-2000-presidential-campaign)).

> It’s ultimately just about that complicated: it hurts. We learn this at like age four – it’s grownups’ first explanation to us of why it’s bad to lie (“How would you like it if … ?”). And we keep learning for years, from hard experience, that getting lied to sucks – that it diminishes you, denies you respect for yourself, for the liar, for the world.

I watched Obama’s interview with Letterman the other day and I think that’s the perfect way to describe him: he treats everyone with respect and even across a vast distance there’s a feeling that someone believes you’re smart and capable.
