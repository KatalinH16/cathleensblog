David Foster Wallace wrote a wonderful piece on [the campaign trail](https://kottke.org/18/04/david-foster-wallace-on-john-mccains-2000-presidential-campaign) of John McCain back in 2000 but my favorite part is where he describes how we’ve been hurt by politics and, subsequently, how that creates a palpable sense of listlessness and ennui in all of us (via [Kottke](https://kottke.org/18/04/david-foster-wallace-on-john-mccains-2000-presidential-campaign)):

> It’s ultimately just about that complicated: it hurts. We learn this at like age four – it’s grownups’ first explanation to us of why it’s bad to lie (“How would you like it if … ?”). And we keep learning for years, from hard experience, that getting lied to sucks – that it diminishes you, denies you respect for yourself, for the liar, for the world.

I love Wallace’s description of everyone’s phones on the trail, too:

> Right now, in fact, most of the starboard side is people on cell phones. There are black cell phones and matte-gray cell phones; one MSNBC lady has a pink cell phone her fiancé got her from Hammacher Schlemmer. Some of the phones are so miniaturized that the mouthpiece barely clears the caller’s earlobe and you wonder how they make themselves heard. There are headset cell phones of various makes and color schemes, some without antennas, plus the aforementioned earplug-and-hanging-podular-speaker cell phones. There are also pagers, beepers, vibrating beepers, voice-message pagers whose chips make all the voices sound distressed, and Palm Pilots that display CNN headlines and full-text messages from people’s different 1-800 answering services, which all 27 of the media on BSl have (1-800 answering services) and often kill time comparing the virtues of and relating funny anecdotes about.
