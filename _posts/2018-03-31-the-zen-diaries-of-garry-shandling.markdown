Last night I watched the new documentary about Garry Shandling by Judd Apatow and I hadn’t quite expected to fall in love with it as much as I did. Quite frankly, it swept me off my feet. There’s so much that I adore about the film – from the way in which they show extracts from Garry’s diaries to the way in it reveals Garry’s eccentricities, his fears, his wild and self-harming ambition, or his kindness. In short: I highly recommend you sit down for a whole evening and watch this thing. It’s delightful.

Here’s the trailer for the documentary:
