Newsletters often feel like having to keep up with extracurricular homework. And so a word of advice for publishing a newsletter, blog post, novel, or literally anything: keep it short and keep it sweet. 

Writing is easy, editing is hard. And itâ€™s important to note that a piece of writing is not somehow more important if it takes us an hour to read it. So: eff the word count! Less homework! More fun!
