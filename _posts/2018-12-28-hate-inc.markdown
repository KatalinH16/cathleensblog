The other day I was reading Craig Mod’s article all about the [Future Book](https://www.wired.com/story/future-book-is-here-but-not-what-we-expected/) and he mentioned Matt Taibbi’s latest venture: [Hate, Inc.](hatehttps://taibbi.substack.com). This is Matt’s newsletter published via [Substack](https://www.substack.com/) but the exciting thing about this is that Matt is publishing whole _books_ via these newsletters, breaking the story down into chapters. 

Matt is one of my favorite writers and I’ve [waxed lyrical](https://robinrendle.com/notes/an-archipeligo-man/) about some of his previous work. I’m currently reading the first book that he published via Substack which is a mostly fictional account of drug dealer Huey Carmichael—so many scenes in this story have kept me on the edge of my seat. 

Supposedly the story is based on the real account of a dealer and the register and tone of each chapter is entirely believable, like this part: 

> You’ve seen _Training Day_, where Scott Glenn has his “pension” buried under his house? There’s some truth to that shit. Even the best growers aren’t always sophisticated. They’ll make money, wrap it, and bury it. From time to time they’ll open it up so it doesn’t get moldy, or even just to look at it. Then they just re-wrap it. 
>
> Up and down the coast of California, man, I guarantee you there’s half a billion dollars buried up there. 

I also love that Taibbi calls these ventures “serial books”
