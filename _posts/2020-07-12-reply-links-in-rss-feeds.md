extract: Jonnie Hallman’s idea for improving RSS entries.

Here’s a smart idea from Jonnie Hallman: adding [a reply link](https://2020.destroytoday.com/blog/reply-link-in-rss-feed-posts) at the end of an entry in an RSS feed. Just as Jonnie mentions there, some folks reach out with smart ideas via email to some notes that I have as well. But I should really encourage those sorts of replies because they’re always interesting to read.

So I just did that! If you ever have thoughts/notes/ideas/criticisms of the stuff I’m writing then just hit reply at the end of this entry and rant away. I might not reply to everything but I will certainly read them all.

Anyway, thanks for the tip, Jonnie.
