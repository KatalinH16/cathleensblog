I found out about [Dream Wiki](https://dreamwiki.sixey.es/welcome.dream/) through Kicks Condor’s [surreal blog](https://www.kickscondor.com/) and damn is this just what I meant about making websites _weird_. I have no idea who made this “GARDEN OF ASSOCIATIVE THOUGHT SLURRY COMBINED FIELD NOTES-CAREFULLY GROWN.” Just...what?

From what I can understand so far this website is a sort of lucid dream, a weird wiki of inconclusive definitions, a drunk dictionary. The definition for [birds](https://dreamwiki.sixey.es/calls.dream/) for example:

> ENVELOP ME IN NOISE... A SANDSTORM OF SOUND... AND SURE ENOUGH, BETWEEN THE GRAINS THERE ARE CALLS FROM OTHER WORLDS. DISTANT WAILING SIRENS, COMING CLOSER BUT STAYING OUT OF REACH... TELLING ME THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING, PERFUMING ME WITH SOMEONE ELSES EXCITEMENT.

Also each time you refresh the page it changes the theme and the use of punctuation on the sides is randomly generated, too:
