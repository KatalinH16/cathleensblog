This website is truly remarkable; it’s a vast archive of photographs that were taken in [NYC throughout the 1940s](https://1940s.nyc/map/photo/nynyma_rec0040_1_00204_0016#13.69/40.7093/-73.99397) but each picture has been geotagged—so you can click anywhere on the map and jump straight to that location. Make sure to click the Outtakes section in the top right, too. That’s where you’ll find a ton of random images and poorly taken pictures where it looks like the camera went off in someone’s pocket as they were crossing the street. 

Remarkable.
