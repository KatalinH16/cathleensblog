“Dealing with fascism is an inevitable part of living alongside other people,” Carlos Maza argues in this excellent video called [How To Be Hopeless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJaE_BvLK6U). 

Maza compares fascism to a plague:

> This is what it means to fight a plague: it's rage, exhaustion, and more often than not, it's mourning. Not just for the way things are, but all the ways things could've been.

This video broke me this morning. It puts words to something that I’ve tried to over and over again. Carlos has me thinking about [potential and loss](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/potential-and-loss) again. But...also regret.

My greatest regret is that I didn’t fight Brexit. I didn't go to any protests. I didn't help at all. Heck, I didn't even vote against it. I was so thoroughly consumed with my own ego that I believed something so utterly batshit could never happen. 

And so I chose to ignore the plague.

But then I watched it roll into my hometown and by then it was too late. My family was consumed whole by racist propaganda; my mom, my dad, my brother. Fascist ideology took hold of their minds until today I barely recognize them.

For years I would call my family. I would pace around my apartment in the middle of the night whilst screaming and wailing and pleading with them. I read everything I could about Brexit, about how to argue against it, and tried to figure out which arguments worked best. Nothing worked.

It seemed so futile, like a virus without a cure. Yet I believed I could purge these fascist sympathies from my family through sheer force of will. Through sheer stubbornness. And love.

Since then I keep coming back to this piece by Dorothy Thompson from 1941 called [Who Goes Nazi?](https://harpers.org/archive/1941/08/who-goes-nazi/). She writes:

> It is an interesting and somewhat macabre parlor game to play at a large gathering of one’s acquaintances: to speculate who in a showdown would go Nazi. By now, I think I know. I have gone through the experience many times—in Germany, in Austria, and in France. I have come to know the types: the born Nazis, the Nazis whom democracy itself has created, the certain-to-be fellow-travelers. And I also know those who never, under any conceivable circumstances, would become Nazis.

> [...] It’s fun—a macabre sort of fun—this parlor game of “Who Goes Nazi?” And it simplifies things—asking the question in regard to specific personalities.
> 
> Kind, good, happy, gentlemanly, secure people never go Nazi.[...] But the frustrated and humiliated intellectual, the rich and scared speculator, the spoiled son, the labor tyrant, the fellow who has achieved success by smelling out the wind of success—they would all go Nazi in a crisis.

Dorothy is describing the same plague, 71 years later we’re still fighting this thing. In Carlos’s video he makes a startling argument: we’ll _always_ be fighting this plague. Fascism isn’t something that ever goes away. The problems within our society and our psyches are buried so deep that it’s impossible to ever fully uproot this thing.

How do we fight the plague? In his video, Carlos quotes Albert Camus in _The Plague_ with perhaps the only answer we have:

> The only means of fighting a plague is common decency.
