I’ve been listening to the interviews on [Longform](http://longform.org/) over the past week—in between cleaning, working, heading to the gym—and they’ve been so consistently insightful. Here are my favourites so far:

- George Saunders on [‘the long corridor’](http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-75-george-saunders) and recognising how difficult and time consuming it is to make something great.
- Ta-Nehisi Coates on his book [*Between the World and Me*](http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-168-ta-nehisi-coates) which I’ve just ordered and cannot wait to dig into. I also checked out an older episode where Ta-Nehisi talks about how [“writers can’t assume that their work is going to cause change”](http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-97-ta-nehisi-coates).
- Rukmini Callimachi on [covering ISIS for the NYT](http://longform.org/posts/previously-on-the-longform-podcast-129-rukmini-callimachi).
