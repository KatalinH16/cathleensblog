Here’s some nifty new fonts from Bold Monday: [Puffin](https://boldmonday.com/typeface/puffin/) and [Puffin Arcade](https://www.boldmonday.com/typefaces/puffin-arcade/), designed by Pieter van Rosmalen. I particularly like the Arcade variant since it’s not often that a font elicits a loud _oooooo!_ when I see it for the first time. 

Puffin Arcade is a bitmap font with lots of different variants that mimic different types of classic video games.
