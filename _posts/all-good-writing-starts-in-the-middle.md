There’s only one writing tip worth paying attention to: always start with the drama.

Whenever I begin reading an article, newsletter, book, or blog post I imagine this onramp unfurling before me as now I must wait patiently in the back seat—the first, second, and third paragraph flashes by before the writer finally peals onto the highway and the subject matter.

Most writing begins like this, without any sense of motion at all. It stops and starts. It sputters forwards as if it doesn’t want us to continue reading. So to make our writing better than all this we must do something extraordinary and unheard of; we must hold off on the introduction, delete all of the unnecessary context, and start things off with a bang.

Because every good story begins in the middle.

Here’s one example: in the first scene of _Uncharted 2_ we do not see Nathan Drake at the train station, buying his ticket, grabbing a coffee, hopping on the train, finding his seat, taking off his coat, and then finally getting settled for the trip. Instead, the game cuts to Drake waking up in his seat upside down with the train teetering on the edge of a cliff in the Himalayas. Suitcases are crashing down all around him and into the open maw of a giant canyon.

Sure, you can begin your story at the train station if you like but that requires so much more skill to hook the reader. Yet if we remove all that context, start with the drama, and then trust the reader to figure out what happened, it ends up being so much more satisfying.

This writing tip applies to video games as much as it does to film: _A New Hope_ begins with two ships in chase. Within half a minute we understand what’s going on without the need for a single word to be spoken or an introductory preamble as to which ship is which. I could go on endlessly with examples. In fiction? “Call me Ishmael.” But wait—who is this? Where am I? What is going on? I have no earthly idea, but tell me more!

Beginning in the middle of a story is a cheap but effective trick and it took me a good decade to figure out. You can tell in my early writing that I want to make sure the reader is tagging along for the ride but it always feels patronizing. I set things up from every angle yet this produces writing that no-one is excited to read. You’re left with a story that’s stuck in the dirt with the tires spinning.

Today I always jump halfway into whatever point I’m trying to make for two reasons. First, this jolts the reader awake. “_Pay attention!_” the introductory sentence should declare. Second, I jump into the middle so that I can then enjoy the fun of trying to explain my way out of it. And one small example of this done well is the introduction to an essay that I wrote years ago all about [typography and graphic design](/essays/a-visual-lexicon.html):

_“First you notice the letter.”_

What does that mean? Who is _you_? What is this whole thing about and what the heck has this got to do with anything? Where am I? Eh?

This essay could’ve started like any other blog post or book or television show about design: “Typography is all around us. It’s the art of visualizing the way that...” blah blah blah! Screw everything about all of that. Instead: throw me in the deep end because otherwise why should I care?

All of this is to say that we need to stop patronizing our readers by explaining everything away. Let us all leave a bit of mystery behind, let our readers fill in the gaps, and always start with the drama.
