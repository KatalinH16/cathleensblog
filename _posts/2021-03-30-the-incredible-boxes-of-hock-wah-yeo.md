A fabulous piece about the videogame box design of Hock Wah Yeo. [Phil Salvador writes](https://obscuritory.com/essay/incredible-boxes-of-hock-wah-yeo/):

> When Yeo was making packaging for a game, the way he thought about it, he was giving the game a physical form. Software is “intangible,” he explained, and when you’re designing a box, it’s a opportunity to give the game a physical shape, to take a digital idea and turn it into a real, three-dimensional object.

> [...] That was the core of Yeo’s design philosophy: getting people to pick up the box. “If you want to sell somebody something,” he said, “it’s gotta be in your hands.”  

I had never seen _The Prince of Persia_ box before but dang is it an absolute beauty.
