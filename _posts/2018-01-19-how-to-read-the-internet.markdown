Before newsletters and social networks there was RSS, a technology that was used by almost everyone to read the web. It was relatively simple, too: through a web-based interface, such as [Google Reader](https://www.google.com/reader/about/), you could subscribe to a website and see everything that had been posted in a list. If you subscribed to a lot of websites then you could scan them all with just a few swipes. On the developer side and under the hood, a web designer would write a little bit of code to post all of their website’s content in a data format that something like Google Reader would then scrape and serve to you.

Why did RSS exist in the first place? Well, strangely enough, way back then folks would have to go to a website everyday just to see if something new had been posted. There was no Twitter or Facebook, and so thankfully RSS solved that problem pretty well. But it was through this humble little data format that something magical took place over time: I began following people on the other side of the world through the ups and downs of their careers, through to the final days of their lives even. Some people wrote about the painful moments of their relationships and recorded their day-to-day struggles, treating their website like an open diary. Others only wrote about a very specific topic such as programming or poetry and were clearly brilliant, but they were mysterious in a way I always found alluring.
 
So RSS was the feed before the Feed. You could see all of your subscriptions of every website at a quick glance but it was something else, too. It was more than a technology or a tool. It somehow fostered communities and friendships across continents; I like to think of RSS as a window into a room with the smartest, kindest people — and sometimes they opened the window and said waved back.

But then, rather suddenly, Google decided to kill Reader. It sucks that the service died but the real problem was that everyone believed that RSS had been murdered, too. In hindsight it’s clear that this was the greatest weakness and flaw of RSS: because Google Reader was a free service (and a decent one, too) developers wouldn’t build tools that would compete with it. Google had hijacked the open technology, destroying the competition by making a free service, and then killed the tool that was so associated with it that RSS and Google Reader appeared to be the same thing. (Insert rant about the relationship between google dot com and the rest of the web here).

The unhealthy bond between RSS and Google Reader is proof of how fragile the web truly is, and it reveals that those communities can disappear just as quickly as they bloomed.

However, with that being said, RSS is not dead. A vast number of websites still support format. And over the years since Reader disappeared there’s been a resurgence of competitive apps and services. Some of these apps do the RSS feed scraping, others simply display that data, and some do both. 

But if you’ve never heard of RSS before, or if you fancy getting back into RSS because the Feeds of other social networks have been stressing you out, then here’s a rough guide of how to do that today.  

This is how I read the web in 2018.


## The Setup
There are two services that I’ve fallen in love with over the years: Reeder ([a macOS](http://reederapp.com/mac/) and [iOS app](http://reederapp.com/ios/) that lets me read those subscriptions) and [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) (a service that saves all my subscriptions and keeps everything in sync between these apps.)

These two are a match made in heaven and I haven’t changed anything about my setup in *years* because it’s precisely what I want. I reckon it’s important to note that there are a number of alternatives out there and so this setup might not be precisely what you want and/or need. 

### Feedbin 
A feed is typically in a format such as [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard), [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), [json](https://jsonfeed.org/) or XML — you don’t really need to care which format it’s in because most services will accept all of them. 

Feedbin is one such service — it’ll scan a list of subscriptions  or feeds I give it, check to see if that particular feed has been updated, and then return the results. Effectively it’s the service that stores all of my RSS subscriptions and makes sure that they’re synced across devices. 

I pay $5 a month for the service but I feel like I get way more than my money’s worth. In fact, Feedbin is sort of like the plumbing of RSS — I don’t interact with the site at all and I think perhaps I’ve logged in only a couple of times over the years but I’m a huge fan of the service. And knowing that I’m a paying customer makes me hopeful that a sustainable business can be built out of it.

Also, if you sign up they have an actual reader built into the web app. You can login, add some subscriptions (by copying and pasting the URL) and there you have it! You can read anything you’d like. Here’s what that UI looks like:

With that being said though I happen to use the Reeder apps for their customization options and offline-storage features. So what I did for my setup was snag the login details from Feedbin and added them to the Reeder apps.


### Reeder 
As I mentioned before, the Reeder apps (not to be confused with Google Reader) are where I spend most of my time instead of hitting up a website to see if it’s been updated. Pretty much everyday I scan all of the websites that I enjoy and find short, long and wildly interesting posts from every corner of the web. I subscribe to tumblr feeds, the work of professional journalists, or the work of fellow web designers and indie novelists. I adore this suite of apps more than words can say.

Anyway, Reeder is an app that will take a login details from a feed reading service and will then display that info like so:

However, in order to read anything from a website you’ll need to add a feed. Once you’ve bought and installed the Reeder app, and then synced it with your Feedbin (or other) account, you can head over to a website and copy its URL. In this instance let’s say it’s nyt.com:

<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">
<source src="/uploads/1.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>

And once you’ve added it there it’ll appear with a collection of the most recent posts in the sidebar:

<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">
<source src="/uploads/2.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>

Of course, over the years I’ve customized Reeder (because I’m a picky type nerd) and so I‘ve set wider text columns and used the Output Sans typeface by David Jonathan Ross for legibility’s sake. It really is the perfect way for me to scan and read the web. 


## Wrapping Up

A friend of mine the other day said that “maybe Medium only exists because Google Reader died — Reader left a vacuum, and the social network filled it.” I’m not entirely sure I agree but it seems possible to me. Likewise, Google Reader is likely what led to the resurgence of newsletters. And yet, however great those little email updates are, they’re mostly unarchived and floating around in people’s inboxes. A lot of them aren’t accessible via a URL and so in time they’ll be forgotten and washed away — some of them might be accessible via the Internet Archive at one point or another, but most of them won’t be.

On a similar note, many believe that [blogging is making a return](https://ia.net/topics/web-trend-map-2018/). Folks now seem to recognize the value of having your own little plot of land on the web and, although it’s still pretty complex to make your own website and control all that content, it’s worth it in the long run. No one can run ads against your thing. No one can mess with the styles. No one can censor or sunset your writing. 

Not only that but when you finish making your website you have gained new superpowers: you now have an independent voice, a URL, and a home on the open web. 

And I think that’s why my feelings about RSS are so strong — I know this sounds peculiar and perhaps even silly, but I have an emotional attachment to RSS the technology and RSS the community that sort of defies explanation. I suppose it’s the same way I feel about my library: I’ve collected a little treasure trove of other people’s ideas, and I’m not entirely sure what my life would look like without them.
