I fell into web design via books; when I was maybe six or seven I remember reading about polar bears and how they hibernated. I found this chapter in a large compendium of information about all sorts of natural habitats – ranging from foxes in the desert and wild horses on the Mongolian plains to Emperor penguins in the Antarctic – and to this day I still remember this giant, double page spread of a bear and her cubs. It was a wondrous illustration but what piqued my curiosity was how the author described hibernation in the accompanying description. 

They called it “time travel for bears.” 

In a flash I realized that the illustrations and the text are the same thing, that they’re two sides of the same coin. And I felt like I had stumbled upon a treasure trove of hidden secrets: I noticed the book as an object, [the shape of the text](https://robinrendle.com/essays/call-me-interactivity/) inside it, and the colors and the texture, the merging of syntax and voice, too. They all swirled around into a delicious, potent mix. 

At that very moment I knew that’s what I wanted to do. As a child of six or seven I knew the answer to the question that had plagued me for what felt like an eternity; what do you want to do when you grow up, kid?

_This!_ I wanted to point at the polar bears and hurl the text up into the faces of all those nosey adults. _I want this._

The reason why I got into front-end development and web design is because of this book about polar bears and it’s why I’m so fascinated in publishing today. I believe I’m a web designer for the same reason that Gutenberg invented his maniacal contraptions half a millennia ago [in the German town of Mainz](https://robinrendle.com/essays/futures-of-typography/); locking type together, hacking away [bits of text](https://robinrendle.com/essays/bookmarking/) in a dark room, and then – blamo! – you print all the paper, you bind all the books, you hit the big green button, and then you publish. That initial thrill of launching a website that you’ve written the copy for, typeset all the paragraphs, programmed the complex insides and inner workings of published things. 

Sure, [web design is different](https://robinrendle.com/essays/new-web-typography/) but that feeling of publishing is why I do what I do. Publishing on the web is an endless thrill, a sort of everlasting, punk-rock feeling and I hope it will never really go away.
