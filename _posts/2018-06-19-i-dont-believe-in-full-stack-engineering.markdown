There, I said it.  Of all the engineers I’ve met over the years only one has come close to what that title, _full-stack engineer_, implies: the ability to easily navigate the back-end and front-end with a senior level of expertise. For the rest of us though, it’s simply not possible to do both. 

And I see bad design _everywhere_ on the web because of this — not necessarily because designers are ill equipped for the task at hand or even that engineers are ignorant of web standards and usability or performance issues. It’s because there’s a whole task of work that’s being left entirely ignored and pushed aside by the folks that are making hiring decisions at these organizations.

_Front-end development_, that is.

I’ve been chatting to a lot of folks lately about this worrisome trend and how employers are simply ignoring this area of expertise known as _front-end development_. But what does that title even mean? Well for me that line of work contains the following skills:

- Semantic, accessible markup
- Experience of writing clear and concise Sass/CSS 
- Caring deeply, even obsessively, about web performance (so that means font loading, images, SVGs, animations, reviewing third party scripts etc.)
- And depending on the size of the org or project, a deep knowledge of React/Angular/whatever in order to make abstract components that can be constantly reused by different teams

Anything that touches the database is not front-end development in my opinion. And that’s only because focus in this line of work is important because yesterday’s hacks become today’s standards and you simply don’t have time to keep up with front-end development if it’s not your sole attention.

And all you design systems folks out there? You’re just front-end developers with a fancy name. And that’s okay! But it’s also sort of annoying to see a line of work that is still vital to the health of the web, and the financial stakes of those companies that don’t really care about this stuff, and it’s sad to see developers rename their titles every six months so that they can get more prestige from fucking LinkedIn of all places.

Not only that but I see a lot of tools trying to replace front-end development under the guise of ‘Design Systems’, too. A lot of tools seem to shout from the heavens: “Designers! Give this mockup to an engineer and all they have to do is copy and paste the CSS! It’s literally impossible to fuck up!”

Humbug, I say.

Every company that ignores front-end development is doing so at their peril; they’ll lose [millions of dollars every year](https://wpostats.com/) because their websites are slow, they’ll [be sued](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-face-lawsuits-over-website-accessibility-for-blind-users-1478005201) for voiding accessibility laws, they won’t be able to ship beautiful interaction models as native interfaces vastly surpass them.

Despite the evidence that front-end development is a focused activity that requires full-time effort I see a lot of companies hiring full-stack engineers and hiring designers without coding experience, and I see design teams focused intently on pixel pushing and making animations without understanding basic HTML structure. I constantly see wildly inaccessible interfaces that don’t have focus states and forms that don’t let you navigate effectively with a keyboard. I see interfaces that feel slow and clunky because really no-one considered how browsers actually function at the most basic of levels.

If you’re only hiring full-stack engineers then you should carefully consider why that’s the case and you should have a grasp of what you’re sacrificing for that lack of focus and expertise in that area. 

Because there’s no such things as a unicorn and there is no such thing as a full-stack engineer.
