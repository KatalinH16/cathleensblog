I’ve read this piece [about design](http://alistapart.com/article/readingdesign) by Dean Allen multiple times and yet I can’t appear to shake it. Every time I do there’s something new that strikes me as a difficulty I’m currently experiencing in my career. 

Here’s on short extract:  

> An Entirely Incomplete List of Things a Non–Illiterate Designer Should Know Before Being a Designer:
> 
> - That text will inevitably be read before it is looked at
> - That words themselves make remarkably effective clip art
> - That the self–conscious layering of messages usually subtracts more value than it adds
> - That the practical value of white space towers over its value as a design element
> - That the physiobiology of reading is one that demands easy points of exit and entry
That simply paying attention to the design of type, or distinguishing it as “fine” or “invisible” or “classical” is like making a big deal about putting salt on a boiled egg
> - That letters are not pictures of things, but things
> - That words are not things, but pictures of things
> - That arbitrarily altering (or allowing software to alter) the shapes of letters, and the spacing between letters and words, is done at one’s own risk
> - That emphasis comes at a cost
> - That overstating the obvious can be effective, but not all the time
> - The precise point at which a quantity of information no longer requires assistance to be differentiated from another
> - The knowledge to back up design decisions clearly without falling into a fog of hidden meaning, or so–called “creativity”
