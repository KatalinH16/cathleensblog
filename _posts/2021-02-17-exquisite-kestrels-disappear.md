Lewis Mcguffie, the designer of [Columba](https://buttondown.email/robinrendle/archive/kickflip-typography/), wrote this piece about [designing with scale in mind](https://lewisandhistype.medium.com/exquisite-kestrels-disappear-317fd3f81cc5):

> Something will always be in the shadows, or even behind a hill, we may be colour-blind, or a thing may simply be too small to see (the list is endless). To put it another way — things change depending on how big they are.

> [...] The design of type requires a knowledge of scale. But with the concession that a typeface will need to be used in a multitude of environments and is effectively a software tool. However, type as illustration does not have to make this concession. An overly ornate letter will likely go no further than the 1080 × 1080 Instagram post it was lovingly crafted for.The letters composing the text you are reading now, is a thing. The other is an illustration, a picture of thing.
