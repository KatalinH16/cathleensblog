A wonderful new piece by Ta-Nehisi Coates [on Kanye West, Michael Jackson, and celebrity](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/):

> ...[Kanye] is a god, though one born of a different time and a different need. Jackson rose in the last days of enigma and wonder; West, in an accessible age, when every fuck is a tweet and every defecation a status update. And perhaps, in that way, West has done something more remarkable, more amazing than Jackson, because he is a man of no mystery, overexposed, who holds the world’s attention through simply the consistent, amazing, near-peerless quality of his work.
