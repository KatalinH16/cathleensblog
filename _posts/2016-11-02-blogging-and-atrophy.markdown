[Jeremy’s post](https://adactio.com/journal/11436) about his first decade with Twitter is interesting in lots of ways, particularly how he describes this in comparison to the longevity of his website:

> I’m not sure if my Twitter account will still exist ten years from now. But I’m pretty certain that my website will still be around.

What concerns me about this sentiment is that I’ve noticed how folks in the Bay Area tend to treat their websites as business cards instead of archives. They think of a personal website as a paragraph of text that clarifies what they do for a living, which is entirely opposite in relation to how I think about personal websites.

How do I see my website? Well, it’s complicated. At the moment I things from two angles:

## #1 My Website as a Stream

This is how I’ve organised [/notes](http://robinrendle.com/notes)—they’re tiny bundles of information as to what I’m thinking about at that particular instance in time. There’s no pressure to polish up the language or sharpen the metaphors, it’s a stream of consciousness that can be fine tuned and edited into tip-top shape later on.

Ideally these pieces of content and design-agnostic. If I change the typeface or the background or add crazy animations to the page then the text itself won’t mean something different.

## #2 My Website as an Archive

This is where I put all of the information that often takes twelve months or so to research, edit, and design — this is how I’ve organised [/essays](http://robinrendle.com/essays) for now.

But this point of view, that a website is an archive that should last for long periods of time, requires a different approach to design. How can I ensure that my work is still available, and accessible, for decades into the future? How can I protect this little piece of the web, place my stamp on it, and preserve it as best I can?

On the 18th January 2013 I decided that I would never delete anything from my site again. Even if it was painfully banal or just plain silly, everything was going to remain in place for as long as possible. The way I make those essays is make a brand new stylesheet, host local fonts and throw away the key. 

Yet slowly, over time, I’m watching these bigger posts break down. Certain features no longer work in browsers as I once remember them; atrophy has set in and it’s like watching the text sink slowly into a pool of mud. 

And that’s ok. Things are going to change a lot considering this website will outlast web platforms and social networks, operating systems and the browsers that run on them (hopefully my website will even outlive me, too). That’s because I don’t want my presence online to resolve into a tacky business card once I’m gone — *I’m an XYZ in San Francisco* — instead, I want it to be an archive of everything that I’ve ever thought was worth keeping around. All the things I’ve [pointed at](http://craigmod.com/sputnik/pointable_01/), linked to, discussed, argued about, all the things I’ve ever loved.
