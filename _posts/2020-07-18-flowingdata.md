I tend to gasp when I see a well designed and up-to-date blog but I double gasped the other day when I stumbled upon Nathan Yau’s data vis blog [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/about/). This example where Nathan looks at a [day in the life of Americans](https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/) is pretty gobsmacking, as is his visualization for [how many years you probably have left to live](https://flowingdata.com/2015/09/23/years-you-have-left-to-live-probably/).

I particularly like that FlowingData posts are half visual extravaganza and half essay, so I’m excitedly adding this one to the ol’ RSS feed.
