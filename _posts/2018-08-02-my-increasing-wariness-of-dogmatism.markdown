I think about [this post all about dogmatism](https://css-tricks.com/increasing-wariness-dogmatism/) by Chris perhaps twice a week:

> Hardly a day goes by I don’t see a dogmatic statement about the web. I was collecting them for a while, but I won't share them as there is no sense in shaming anyone. I'm as guilty as anyone.
> 
> The dogmatic part comes from the way an opinion is phrased. I feel like people do it sometimes just for emphasis. To sound bold and proud, via brevity.

I catch myself in this mode sometimes, of boldly declaring “that’s not the way to do it!” when it comes to front-end development or design. But dogmatism isn’t helpful, it doesn’t make me sound clever or wise, and it just increases the wariness of people around me to ask for help or guidance on an issue.
