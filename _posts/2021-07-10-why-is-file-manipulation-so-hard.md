So I don’t know bash. But why do I need to learn it to, say, grab all the files in a folder and prepend some text to the beginning? Why if I want to do anything with files or text or manipulate any file into another kind of file I always have to download some other third party app or find some weird script somewhere?

All computers do is take a file, turn it into another kind of file, or edit/delete/etc. They manipulate one form of data into something else.

If that’s the case then why do I still need to learn how to use bash in 2021? It seems so archaic to me. There should be an app (kinda like [Permute](https://software.charliemonroe.net/permute/)) that lets me manipulate text documents.

It’s like all the power of this computer is locked behind a pane of glass, just because I don’t want to memorize or learn this dumbass language that is barely readable. I don’t want to have to dig through `man` docs. I don’t want to create a script and then run it. 

I want all the power of coding without any of the coding. 

Make the computer meet me where I am.
