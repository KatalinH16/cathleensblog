Supposedly TinyLetter [won’t be shutting down in 2018](http://mailchi.mp/6b0e9256cfd5/a-note-about-tinyletter) but  it seems like it’s being sunsetted and/or merged into the larger MailChimp suite of products. Although that’s probably okay for most TinyLetter fans I’ve always wanted to experiment with a new setup that’s optimized specifically for writing Markdown and that’s only since [Adventures](https://robinrendle.com/adventures/) doesn’t need an elaborate layout or anything, I don’t even want those emails to be pretty, and so thankfully it looks like such a tool exists already: [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) by [Justin Duke](https://twitter.com/justinmduke).

There’s so many cool things about this project, not only the features and copywriting which appear to be outstanding, but also the fact that Buttondown’s [running costs are public](https://buttondown.email/running-costs).
