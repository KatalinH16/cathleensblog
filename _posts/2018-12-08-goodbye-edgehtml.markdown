Chris Beard has written about all [the drama](https://twitter.com/robinrendle/status/1070111363563872256) surrounding Microsoft killing off EdgeHTML and he makes [a lot of great points](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/06/goodbye-edge/):

> Will Microsoft’s decision make it harder for Firefox to prosper? It could. Making Google more powerful is risky on many fronts. And a big part of the answer depends on what the web developers and businesses who create services and websites do. If one product like Chromium has enough market share, then it becomes easier for web developers and businesses to decide not to worry if their services and sites work with anything other than Chromium. That’s what happened when Microsoft had a monopoly on browsers in the early 2000s before Firefox was released. And it could happen again.
