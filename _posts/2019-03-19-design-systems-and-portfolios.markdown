I wrote up some opinions I have about [design systems and portfolios](https://css-tricks.com/design-systems-and-portfolios/) for CSS-Tricks:

> In my experience working with design systems, I’ve found that I have to sacrifice my portfolio to do it well. Unlike a lot of other design work where it’s relatively easy to present Dribbble-worthy interfaces and designs, I fear that systems are quite a bit trickier than that.
> 
> You could make things beautiful, but the best work that happens on a design systems team often isn’t beautiful. In fact, a lot of the best work isn’t even _visible_.

[Jennie Yip replied](https://twitter.com/jenniesyip/status/1106731290122813440) and mentioned that their is a way to show design systems work in a portfolio, pointing to [the lovely work of Jocelyn Wong](https://jocelyn-wong.com/project-modal-component.html). But I guess maybe my point got lost in the rant a little. 

What I was trying to say is that making beautiful things is, quite frankly, easy. Making a beautiful system is hard – and to do that well you often have to sacrifice the beauty of this one component or this one project for the overall harmony of the system.
