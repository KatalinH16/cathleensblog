Over on Typographica, the type designer [Agyei Archer](https://agyei.design) has written a wonderful piece about [fascism and type design](https://typographica.org/on-typography/type-choice-political-choice/):

> The quiet act of knowingly using a typeface designed by a supporter of fascism, and then vigorously defending that position, speaks to determined, privileged ignorance, and poses additional challenges to entry. It could even be enough to keep someone from wanting to fulfill their potential with type. In an environment where there are so many high-quality fonts produced every day, selecting a particular typeface becomes more and more an active choice. Typeface selection isn’t just about aesthetics, or features. It’s also about context and source — especially now. In other words, you don’t _have_ to use a typeface designed by a fascist. You _choose_ to.
