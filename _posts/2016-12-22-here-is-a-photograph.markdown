Since my family rarely took photographs when I was young, I now happen to see every picture as a little time-travelling jewel. Here’s an example of one that I particularly adore:

My father has returned home from a fishing trip and is unpacking his ghastly spoils for us in the kitchen. The first monster he reveals from the black bag has immediately captivated our attention, and for good reason: I’ve just turned four and my younger brother, that inquisitive young chap with the sippy cup, is no more than two years old.

But perhaps unlike any other picture of my brother and me, this is the one that shows how we view the world from two very separate vantage points.

Let me explain.

I can tell from a quick glance here that my brother is thinking about the practical implications of fishing. How did they catch the fish? How did you get all the way out into the ocean? What was the boat they used? For how long did they travel? What’s the difference between a fishing boat and a regular old boat? How many fish did they catch?

On the other hand, I’m standing there wondering what the name of the fish might’ve been – not the name of the species, mind you – I’m obsessed with what the first and last name of this creature was.

I love these differences between us and I can’t help but think this image captures our relationship so well: it shows his painstaking attention to how the actual world works alongside my alternative, Utopian and dream-like version.
