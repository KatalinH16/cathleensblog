That’s me on the far right, my brother with the sippy cup, and my Dad with the fish on the left. He’s just returned home from a fishing trip and had begun unpacking when he noticed that our attention was suddenly all his.

But that’s not what really interests me about this picture.

Of all the photographs my family has taken over the years, this is really the one that shows how my brother and I view the world from two very separate vantage points. From a quick glance I can tell that my brother here is thinking about the practical implications of fishing. How did they catch the fish? What did the boat look like? How many fish did they catch and what do they taste like? 

On the other hand, I’m standing beside him wondering what the name of the fish might’ve been – not the name of the species, mind you – I’m obsessed with what the first and last name of this creature was.
