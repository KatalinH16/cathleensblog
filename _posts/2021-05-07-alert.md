extract: A big update to Sentry Alerts.

My first real big project at Sentry landed the other day: a sweeping update to alerts.

With Sentry you can set up an alert to monitor [when your users see 404 pages](https://katydecorah.com/code/monitor-404s-with-sentry/) or we can alert you when your app has too many errors or when [a Core Web Vital is too dang slow](https://twitter.com/bentlegen/status/1390376607756468226?s=20). There’s a host of other things we can alert you about too which is why we now show you a handy list of examples:

Once you’ve set one up you can head to the Alerts page where you’ll see a list of the alert rules you’ve created and all of their statuses. If everything is green? Neato, you don’t have to worry about anything. But if an alert rule detects a problem then it will float to the top of the list:

Okay, neat. So let’s say you have an alert that’s shouting at you about the Largest Contentful Paint on the Checkout page. Not to worry, if you click on that alert you’ll now find a page that explains what the current status of that alert is and it’ll show you some hints as to what the problem might be.
