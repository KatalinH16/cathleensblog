extract: A big update to Sentry Alerts.

My first big project at Sentry landed the other day: a sweeping update to alerts.

With Sentry you can set up an alert to monitor [when your users see 404 pages](https://katydecorah.com/code/monitor-404s-with-sentry/) or we can alert you when your app has too many errors or when [a Core Web Vital is too dang slow](https://twitter.com/bentlegen/status/1390376607756468226?s=20). There’s a host of other things we can alert you about too which is why we now show you a handy list of examples when you’re creating an alert:

Once you’ve set one up you can head to the Alerts page where you’ll see a list of the alert rules you’ve created and all of their statuses. If everything is green? Neato, you don’t have to worry about anything. But if an alert rule detects a problem then it will float to the top of the list and tell you what’s on fire:

Okay, neat. So let’s say you have an alert that’s shouting at you about the [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) on the Checkout page. Not to worry, if you click on that alert you’ll now find a page that explains what the current status of that alert is and it’ll show you some hints as to what the problem might be.

You can see which transactions are slow or which specific issues have been created when you alert on error events as well. The idea here is to show you the problem and then show you how to fix it, so with that in mind there’s a whole ton of improvements we hope to make in the future, too. 

We’re pretty dang happy with how this project turned out but your scalding, uncompromisingly brutal feedback is always very welcome. Also compliments. I love those, too.
