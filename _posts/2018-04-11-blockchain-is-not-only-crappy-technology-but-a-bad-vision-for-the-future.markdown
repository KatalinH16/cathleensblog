This piece by Kai Stinchcombe on [why blockchain is a terrible idea](https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec) is delightful and he tackles the crazy idea that blockchain is a magical wand that solves the “trust problem” between groups of people. My favorite point is this one though:
