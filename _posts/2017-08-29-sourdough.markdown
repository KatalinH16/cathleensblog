Robin Sloan’s [_Sourdough_](https://www.robinsloan.com/books/sourdough/) is a precious thing. It’s a novel set in the Bay Area about mysterious bread and programming AI robot. I would mention something more about the protagonist or the main drive of the story but I don’t want to spoil even a single moment of the book. You must read it as soon as possible.

To be quite honest I was a little worried before I picked up my copy. Robin’s previous book [_Mr Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore_](https://www.robinsloan.com/books/penumbra/) and its prequel [_Ajax Penumbra: 1969_](https://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Penumbra-1969-Robin-Sloan/dp/1782395172) are amongst my very favorites. So there was a niggling concern in the back of my mind; would this story be as delightful as those two previous thrillers about secret societies, libraries and books?

I’m delighted to report that yes, _Sourdough_ is unequivocally brilliant.

Returning to Robin’s prose though is like picking up a P.G. Wodehouse story once again. There’s a jovial, light hearted buzz about everyone and everything in the universe of _Sourdough_ that makes it difficult to put down – I think I read the book in three big gulps. 

In short, you should stop reading this and preorder Robin’s book immediately.



Also, attention San Francisco folk! Robin is speaking at Green Apple Books on the Park on 9/7 and I will most certainly be there to hear tales of books about this mysterious sourdough bread.
