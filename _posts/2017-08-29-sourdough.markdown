Robin Sloan’s [_Sourdough_](https://www.robinsloan.com/books/sourdough/) is a precious thing. It’s a novel set in the Bay Area about the making of a mysterious bread and the programming of an artificial intelligence for a robotic hand. I would mention something more about the protagonist or the main drive of the plot but I don’t want to spoil even a moment of the book.

To be quite honest I was a little worried before I picked up my copy though. Robin’s previous work with [_Mr Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore_](https://www.robinsloan.com/books/penumbra/) and its prequel [_Ajax Penumbra: 1969_](https://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Penumbra-1969-Robin-Sloan/dp/1782395172) are amongst my very favorites. So there was a niggling concern in the back of my mind; would this story be as delightful as those two previous thrillers about secret societies, libraries and books?

I’m delighted to report that yes, _Sourdough_ is unequivocally brilliant.

The only thing I’ll mention about it is that returning to Robin’s prose is like picking up a P.G. Wodehouse story once again. Somehow you’ve forgotten how stories are capable of being jovial, light hearted or funny and you suddenly realize how not every story needs to be a violent, dystopian apocalypse where monsters rip each other to pieces. In a delightful twist, everyone and everything in the universe of _Sourdough_ buzzes with enthusiasm. And it’s this sort of Parks and Recreation-esque sensibility that makes it almost impossible to put down — I think I read the book in three gulps (which is especially rare for me these days).

In short, you should stop reading this and preorder Robin’s book immediately.

Also, attention San Francisco folk! Robin is speaking at Green Apple Books on the Park on 9/7 and I will most certainly be there to hear tales of books about this mysterious sourdough bread.
