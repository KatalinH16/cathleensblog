I love what Jeremy has to say here about [frameworks and the web](https://adactio.com/journal/13964):

> I’ve come to believe that the goal of any good framework should be to make itself unnecessary

...and how that relates to the AMP project:

> If the AMP project existed in order to create a web where AMP was no longer needed, I think I could get behind it. But the more it’s positioned as the only viable solution to solving performance, the more uncomfortable I am with it.
> 
> Which, by the way, brings me to one of the most pernicious ideas around Google AMP—positioning anyone opposed to it as not caring about web performance. Nothing could be further from the truth. It’s precisely because performance on the web is so important that it deserves a long-term solution, co-created by all of us: not some commandents delivered to us from on-high by one organisation, enforced by preferential treatment by that organisation’s monopoly in search.

My hot take on this? I think Google (the company) knows precisely what they’re doing and they hide their intent beneath obfuscation because they don’t quite want to say “we want to own the whole damn thing. We want search, we want maps, and we want your damn website, too.” I think that Google (the developers working on AMP) truly believe their work fixes the performance issues on the web.
