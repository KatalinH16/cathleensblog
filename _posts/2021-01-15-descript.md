[Descript](https://www.descript.com/) is incredible; it’s an app for making transcriptions and recording podcasts/videos. The interface for editing everything is absolutely buck wild because you can edit the transcribed text from the audio you’ve recorded and that will then change the audio itself.

Not only that but this thing is _designed_. Everything feels like it’s in the right spot, presented at the right time. I’m sat here wondering how much of this I can apply to my own work, too.
