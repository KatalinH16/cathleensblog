You can see the climate crisis everywhere, in everything. 

On the drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles you can see the climate crisis in the political ads that dot the highways: “BUILD DAMS!” is one such common sign, posted in the dirt by a farm on the edge of the freeway. “PLEASE, WE NEED WATER” another sign begs in giant sans-serif letters next to it. The climate crisis is in the crops that stretch to the horizon and hills that ought to be green but are a Mad Max gold instead. You can feel the climate crisis in the air itself when pulses of heat ripple through the land, just a few degrees short of becoming unbearable, unlivable. 

It’s clear that the climate crisis isn’t going to be some distant trouble of Nairobi or Singapore and you don’t need a degree in climate science to see that California is a paradise in the midst of a catastrophe. 

All the signs are here.

Los Angeles starts with a bang; after a five hour drive on a dead-straight road and caught under the gaze of a mean star you’re welcomed into the city by a national park and roads that swoop, duck, and peak around the hillsides as if they want you to play with them in the shadows. And play you do. Your super cool bad boy motorcycle is alert now, he perks up – this is the type of road that he’s been waiting for.

Winding highways that are peculiarly empty lead you through Beverly Hills at dusk. Playboys are driving around in Bugattis and Ferraris but you’re much faster, you’re nimble, and you dart between them with ease. Your motorcycle is a high precision tool, one dances between their expensive, flash cars that are stuck in traffic nonetheless. With a light touch on the throttle you blitz past them and leave them in your dust.

The next day is your birthday. You wake up, head up through the hills and around Mulholland Drive. You see the urban sprawl for the first time in all its wonder. You gasp at this thing people have built in such a short amount of time. 

LA is not a city, it’s a megacity – a metropolis built around the automobile. And the whole time you’ve been wondering where all the movie money goes, you turn a corner and you realize that it’s just been plowed back into the hillsides. Hundreds, thousands of mansions and gorgeous homes dot the cliffs and valleys of the surrounding neighborhoods. 

Something like this in England would be torn down in a heartbeat but, out here, flaunting wealth in this way is somehow inspirational to people. We would likely see it as capitalism on steroids. Mass hysteria. People just shouldn’t have this much money. It’s broken, the whole damn thing is broken, you think as you wind around the hillsides.

After driving around the city all day you realize how poorly it’s been designed for human people. Not just because of the highways and cars or even the layout of the buildings. But it’s the heat instead. There’s just no shade anywhere, as either people have gotten used to this or they stay inside their cars and homes where air conditioning is easily found.

It’s impossible to get anywhere without a car in LA but it’s impossible to park anywhere with a car. Thankfully your bike can fit. And it’s free, too. You ride up to the Griffith Observatory and see the haze of pollution that hovers over the city at all times of the day, producing beautiful sunsets of orange and the brightest of pinks.

The next day you’re on the bike again. You’re bored of the heat and since a kid you’ve wanted to drive on the Pacific Coast Highway. First stop: Malibu.

You’re going to drive the whole thing. Fourteen hours, all the way back up to San Francisco, you realize. You smile and push on to the next city; Santa Barbara, then Santa Maria.

Billy (my motorcycle’s temporary name whilst I think of a better replacement) was a fine companion. 

The Pacific Coast Highway, the winding paths that skirt the tip of the ocean and the land, is a famously beautiful road. And it certainly didn’t disappoint. Quite frankly it was the most beautiful ride I’ve ever embarked on.
