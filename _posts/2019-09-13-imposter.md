Rach Smith on why we should be more careful when we use the phrase [‘imposter syndrome’](https://rachsmith.com/2017/i-dont-have-imposter-syndrome/):

> When I see my wildly successful, senior developer peers talk publicly about how they deal with imposter syndrome I can see the intent behind it. They want to be approachable, relatable: “internet famous senior devs – they’re just like us!”. I agree that it is important to highlight the ways in which we are all the same because it drives the message home that any dev (given they have the time and access) could achieve the same level of success. I just really wish we could do this without labelling normal and healthy moments of self doubt with “imposter syndrome.”
