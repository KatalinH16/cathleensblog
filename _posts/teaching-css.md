Rachel Andrew has written all about her career [helping developers learn CSS](https://css-tricks.com/teaching-css/):

> As I started my CSS layout journey with a backdrop of people complaining about Netscape 4, I now continue against a backdrop of people whining about IE11. As our industry grows up, I would love to see us leaving these complaints behind. I think that this starts with us teaching CSS as a robust language, one which has been designed to allow us to present information to multiple environments, to many different people, via a sea of ever-changing devices.

Some things change, but most things donâ€™t.
