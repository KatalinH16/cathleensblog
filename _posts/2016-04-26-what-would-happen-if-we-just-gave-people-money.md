extract: From Switzerland to the Netherlands to Kenya to Silicon Valley, a mixture
  of insecurity and curiosity are driving interest in basic income, but its dominant
  ideology — and appeal — is utopian. The core existential struggle lurking in the
  debates over basic income centers on what meaning work holds in our lives. Straub,
  the Swiss referendum organizer, remembers his great-grandfather working 10 hours
  per day, six days per week. That kind of toil is no longer necessary, nor desirable.
  The dream of a world where we produce more than we need has come true.

This is [a sharp and brilliant piece](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/universal-basic-income/) by Andrew Flowers. He looks at the current research behind universal basic income, where the government would effectively cut social benefits and replace them with a single wage for both rich and poor alike.

Certainly not all social programs should be cut, but this discussion is absolutely fascinating nonetheless.
