I think typography is often mistaken for knowing about the right fonts and remembering the names or styles of typefaces. Subsequently typography is often the pedant’s weapon of choice for making people feel dumb. And just as design is not the art of having opinions and tweeting about them, typography is not the art of dunking on people that say ‘fonts’ inside of ‘type’.

There’s one particular person I’m thinking of here. He’s famous for sliding into conversations between type folks when they’re having a discussion on Twitter and he breaks up the party with a “WELL, ACTUALLY.”
