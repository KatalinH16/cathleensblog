I think typography is often mistaken for knowing about the right fonts and remembering the names or styles of typefaces. Subsequently typography is often the pedant’s weapon of choice for making people feel dumb. And just as design is not the art of having opinions and tweeting about them, typography is not the art of dunking on people that say ‘fonts’ inside of ‘type’.

There’s a guy that’s famous for sliding into conversations between type folks when they’re having a discussion on Twitter. He will always break up the party with a “WELL, ACTUALLY” no matter what the topic or who happens to be speaking.
