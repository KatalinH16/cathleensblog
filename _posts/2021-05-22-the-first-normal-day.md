extract: And the color of that blue.
---
The sky was so very blue yesterday. The kind of California blue that I won’t ever leave behind. These are the sorts of days that are simply impossible in England—the blue is different, it’s faded out slightly like it is on the East Coast—but just when you think that things cannot possibly improve, that’s when the sky sneaks up on you with a prolonged evening of dazzling colors crashing into one another. It’s a yellowy-gold explosion blanket of color that descends upon us after all that glorious blue fades away...and what can be said about that? That great fire storm of orange and purples and yellows? Words are straight up useless here. 

I mention the color of the sky because yesterday was the first normal day in a very long time. It was the sort of day where we could sit in a place with strangers and just think about the color of the sky without the looming threat of a virus upon us. Here we are so very lucky, so very privileged, I thought, to enjoy the color of this blue. To chat about future plans. To hug this funny weirdo I just met.

Before the colors exploded in they sky, we headed out across the bridge and over to Bernal to look at an apartment. I’ve never moved in with anyone or even gone to look at a place, in fact. And yet this tour of a beautiful home—a striking white building against that striking blue—it felt so very normal, so very *obvious* to me. Of course we’re looking at a place together. Of course this is my person.

As the realtor asked us questions I zoned out for a bit, thinking about what fun we’d have in this long hallway, what fun we’d have in the living room giggling about tomato frogs or baked beans. I thought about us here in this room; Celine playing a puzzle game in bed whilst I read a book or perhaps by then I’ll still be ranting incoherently about how awful the ending of season 4 of Castlevania was. “Oh this vampire dude was...Death? And Dracula’s charming wife was totally okay about her husband becoming a genocidal maniac? All is forgiven? Extremely cool!” I’d shout in an extremely un-cool way whilst Celine click-clacks houses and rivers and foxes together, soft piano music drifting along the corridor.

The daydream stopped though when I entered one of rooms. “Now here,” I whispered menacingly, "here I could write something beautiful.” Buckets of coffee and diet coke would be drunk at this desk and ten million blog posts would be typed out here. Oh the furious typing I could do this in room!

After the daydreams, we went to Roxie’s in the Inner Sunset for some British chocolates. I picked up Marmite and crouched for a picture with some baked beans as if I were praying to them.

We traveled back across the bridge to a beer garden in Berkeley. A BART line boomed up above us; it zipped over and across the beer garden and it felt suddenly more like Berlin or Amsterdam than it did the Bay Area. And this trip into Berkeley had me thinking. Perhaps I’d ignored it until now as a possibility; Berkeley has always been a place annoyingly far away, perhaps always a little too sleepy for my liking. But now I could see myself biking up and down these streets from one cafe to the next. I could see us renting a place on a quiet corner somewhere. 

As we drove back home I spotted San Francisco on the horizon, across the water, and it showed me a new face. From this distance SF now looked like a towering utopia, a place of pure science fiction. It looked like a place you see in brief flashes in Star Trek or something and now I  could begin to see the appeal of folks living in Berkeley. It is the perfect distance to sit back and admire the city without having to live with all the limitations and foibles and structural terribleness of the real city. From way out here you could imagine a better San Francisco.
