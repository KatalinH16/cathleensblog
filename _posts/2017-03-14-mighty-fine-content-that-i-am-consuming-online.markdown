I’ve been reading a lot of great things thru Instapaper lately and just wanted to quickly jot everything down as best I could.

Here’s a great post by Tim Carmody on [what Blue-America should with Red-America](http://beltmag.com/sorry-called-blue-states-dont-get-walk-away/):

> In America — whether in its cities, states, or the entire country, the rich and poor of every race, religion, and gender, gay, straight, and nonbinary, and yes, citizen and noncitizen — we are all one body. Our fates are locked together. The red states feed the people of the blue; the blue states shelter the people of the red. The world, with its many members, is all one body. When we hurt or misunderstand each other, we only hurt and misunderstand ourselves.

On a similar note: when the Brexit vote came in I was walking around with some friends and one of them pinched me. “The vote just came in,” she said. “And I’m so sorry.”

But there was this little part of me that was like _good riddance_. If my home country wants to mutilate itself then so be it – I’ve chosen America as my new home. And yet six months later my new elective country...well, yeah. I feel pretty guilty about feeling that way now.

Nicole Zhu on [the lack of Asian American representation in films and TV](https://medium.com/@nz/aesthetics-and-absence-asian-american-representation-onscreen-639222812a1b#.asfjpq4gx): 

> These reasons are also ultimately copouts that point to a much larger problem: Asian Americans are never seen as top-billed actors and actresses because they are not given the chance, not even in their own stories. We lose out on both the money and the prominence that it takes to convince studios that we are worth investing in, as well as the optics and representation it takes to convince audiences that we can be reflected meaningfully in the entertainment we consume. Asian culture, aesthetics, stories, and stereotypes are everywhere, but god forbid a movie contains multidimensional Asian characters who might be superheroes or romantic leads or tortured billionaire geniuses or carry multimillion dollar franchises or have their own fucking Lego figures...

I particularly enjoyed this piece by Ross Andersen for the Atlantic called _Welcome to the Future Range of the Woolly Mammoth_. Andersen interviews a bunch of scientists that attempting to revive mammoths in a bid to save the world. It makes for super interesting reading:

> The mammoth’s extinction may have been our original ecological sin. When humans left Africa 70,000 years ago, the elephant family occupied a range that stretched from that continent’s southern tip to within 600 miles of the North Pole. Now elephants are holed up in a few final hiding places, such as Asia’s dense forests. Even in Africa, our shared ancestral home, their populations are shrinking, as poachers hunt them with helicopters, GPS, and night-vision goggles. If you were an anthropologist specializing in human ecological relationships, you may well conclude that one of our distinguishing features as a species is an inability to coexist peacefully with elephants.
