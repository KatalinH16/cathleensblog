I’m not a fan of Wes Anderson movies. I mean I love the style and the songs and the acting of course but the plot always falls a little short – characters will begin to say quirky things that aren’t in service of the narrative. At one point or another in the movie there’ll be a moment where everyone starts talking as if they’re reading the first sentence of a paragraph and hopping over the sentences in between to the next paragraph.

I always wanted someone to jump in at those moments during the editing process and ask Wes to be 10% less Wes. Just a tiny bit.

Watching [Isle of Dogs](https://letterboxd.com/film/isle-of-dogs-2018/) last night at the Alamo though was the first time where I felt that the whole damn thing worked. All of the parts fit; the graphic design was outstanding, the music was lovely. But most importantly, the characters all had motivations and narrative arcs and all the things that I crave from a film.

And it was wondrous.
