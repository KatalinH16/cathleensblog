extract: Andy Biao’s thoughts on Quora.

I really like how Andy Biao describes Quora’s practices as “isolationist” in this post about [why you should never use their service](https://waxy.org/2018/12/why-you-should-never-ever-use-quora/):

> At some point, the investors who dumped a quarter billion dollars into it will want a return on that investment. Last year, founder Adam D’Angelo [indicated](https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/21/quora-raises-85-million-to-expand-internationally-and-develop-its-ads-business/) they expect to eventually IPO. But market conditions, combined with the results of their ad platform, may force them in different directions — a pivot, merger, or acquisition are always a possibility.

> When Quora shuts down, and it will eventually shut down one day, all of that collected knowledge will be lost unless they change their isolationist ethos.

I’ve never used Quora and I feel like the issues that Andy outlines in his post is probably why. The same thing applies to Pinterest as well — although I’m not sure about their API or content policies — whenever I’ve used it I feel like it’s a service on the web, but not of the web.
