I’m not sure if you’ve heard about this but [The History of the Web](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/) newsletter is simply outstanding and you ought to sign up immediately if publishing, web design and development is in your wheelhouse. 

One of my favorite posts is this one: imagine a time before images on the web. For years there was nothing but a sea of text and then, in the summer of 1993 the Mosaic browser launched with [the quiet, humble introduction of the `img` tag](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-origin-of-the-img-tag/). It changed everything about the web. 

And I think that’s why I adore this newsletter – with each issue it reminds me that the web is this amorphous, ever-changing community of technologies that can change over time. This little newsletter reminds me that the web is an exciting, wondrous, unfinished place.
