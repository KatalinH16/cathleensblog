Frequently my work in the field of design systems isn’t about pushing an interface to the best visual fidelity or using the coolest and most crazy CSS tricks. It’s also not about building the most beautiful interface with the most delightful interactions in the world.

Instead – and this is something I fear a lot of folks generally don’t quite get – is that it’s about evaluating damage to the system. It’s about understanding future risks. 

Good design systems work is not about consistency. It’s about doing the least harm. For example: the more non-reusable parts we have in our front-end, the more likelihood there is for visual regressions and bugs.
