Over the past week or so I’ve been reading [Spineless](https://www.amazon.com/Spineless-Science-Jellyfish-Growing-Backbone/dp/0735211264) which is a book by [Juli Berwald](http://www.juliberwald.com/) all about jellyfish. I picked it up in the Haight only because of the design of its cover and the random paragraph that I flipped to – but that would be enough. I knew this book was going to be a lovely book about I topic I have zero interest or knowledge in.

I think the reason why I would recommend this book, even before I’ve finished reading it, is because jellyfish question everything that we know about life. How they move, how they see, how they eat, how they process information. It’s alien and beyond comprehension and sci-fi as all hell *and* I love it.

After reading some of the reviews a lot of folks don’t appear to like the personal and relationship stories that Juli describes in the book – about her husband, her kids, previous relationships that were knotted together in with her love for jellyfish. But I really liked that stuff, it felt much closer to a blog or a diary and so I would heartily recommend this book if you’re interested in an upbeat collection of stories about how someone fell in love with a topic, how it became an obsession for them, and how they discovered one of the strangest bunch of creatures on the planet.
