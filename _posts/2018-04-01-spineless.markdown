Over the past week or so I’ve been reading [Spineless](https://www.amazon.com/Spineless-Science-Jellyfish-Growing-Backbone/dp/0735211264) which is a book by [Juli Berwald](http://www.juliberwald.com/) all about jellyfish. I picked it up in the Haight only because of the design of its cover and the random paragraph that I flipped to – but that would be enough. I knew this book was going to be a lovely tale about a topic that I have zero interest or knowledge in.

I think the reason why I would recommend this book, even before I’ve finished reading it, is because jellyfish question everything that we know about life; how they move, how they see, how they eat, how they process information. Everything about them is alien and beyond comprehension and sci-fi as all hell.

After reading some of the reviews a lot of folks don’t appear to like the personal and relationship stories that Juli details in the book – about her husband, her kids, previous relationships that were knotted together in with her love for jellyfish. But I really liked that stuff, it felt much closer to a blog or a diary and so I would heartily recommend this book if you’re interested in an upbeat collection of stories about how someone fell in love with a topic, how it became an obsession for them, and how they discovered one of the strangest bunch of creatures on the planet.
