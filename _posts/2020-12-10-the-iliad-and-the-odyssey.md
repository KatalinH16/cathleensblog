extract: Alberto Manguel on “the idea of Homer.”
---
I’ve been reading the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ because I’m on an Alberto Manguel bender and before you yawn and click away—wait! This book sure is yawn inducing from a mile away but up close I think it’s extremely interesting.

That’s because these sorts of books are usually quite often terrible. Writing about the classics is hard—I’d say nigh on impossible—because everything has already been said them but also because everyone is trying to _impress_ everyone else, instead of writing clearly. Just like in writing about design, there’s a stuffiness and snooty sort of writing when it comes to literary criticism that I find absolutely unbearable. I’m allergic to the stuff.

But not here! As of course, with all things Manguel, this is a book about books. What he does instead is this: yes, sure, he’s writing about two epic poems attributed to an “idea called Homer.” Yet he’s really writing about how these two stories (what eventually would form two books centuries later, once books had been invented) are loved, interpreted, fought over, and generally just how people _struggled_ with these stories.

Even just _thinking_ about the great expanse of time between us and these stories are baffling. Books did not exist when they formed. For hundreds of years these stories were most likely shared like songs (the original translations show us that they have a lot of repetition which is edited out in later translations). No single person wrote either the _Iliad_ or the _Odyssey_, possibly and bards would sing for house and board, which might explain the length of these stories, too. 

I find that idea beautiful, how these stories just sort of coalesced over centuries. They were edited, rewritten, destroyed, burned, banned. And they were added to, updated, _changed_.

It is an absolute wonder that these stories still survive.
