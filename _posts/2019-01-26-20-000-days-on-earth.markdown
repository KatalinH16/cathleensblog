extract: And a note about the weather.
---

One of my favorite movies is Nick Cave’s *[20,000 Days on Earth](https://letterboxd.com/film/20000-days-on-earth/)* which is part documentary and part autobiographic visual essay. Throughout the film Nick talks about his writing, his music making, how he met Kylie Minogue, and how he fell in love with his wife. I’ve watched it four times now and with each viewing I find something else to love about it. 

This time around I noticed Nick’s obsession with the weather and how it sees Brighton’s storms as something unrelenting, a warning of the future. 

Nick looks up at the sky as clouds smash into one another and lighting crackles on the horizon. “The sky in Brighton is unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” he says. “What I fear most is nature—now that it’s sent it’s weather to exact revenge...soon the weather will put on a real show.”

He’s also obsessed with the weather: “You know I can control the weather with my moods,” Nick mentions as he’s driving along the main thoroughfare of Brighton’s seaside. “I just can’t control my moods.”

Nick writes in a way that makes me mad with jealousy. It’s the last panel of a comic book stuff. You the know the one, where all is lost and the double page spread ends on a note of tragedy, but the hero is defiant against all odds and all those calamitous tragedies that have led to this. 

The hero has lost and yet he’s smiling.
