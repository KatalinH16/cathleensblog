extract: The art of writing software in a group.

I love this bit from a post by Georgy Marchuk on [a minimal JavaScript setup](https://css-tricks.com/a-minimal-javascript-setup/) but it’s really all about the difficulty of writing software as a group: 

> The success of a development team starts with an agreement. An agreement of how things are done. Without an agreement, code would get messy, and the software unsustainable quite quickly, even for relatively small projects. Therefore, a lot (if not most) of the power of a framework lies within this agreement. The ability to define conventions and common patterns that everyone adheres to. That idea is applicable to any framework, JavaScript or not. Those "rules" are essential to development and bring teams maintainability at any size, reusability of code, and the ability to share work with a community in a form anyone will understand.

This is what I meant the other day when I wrote that “[every interface is an argument](https://buttondown.email/robinrendle/archive/513a2f17-6d8b-4cfb-a5d5-0ac009a65e3f).” At one point or another you can see it in the design of an interface and you can see how an organization works. 

Are there inconsistencies in the position of elements? In the typesetting? In the colors that they use? Are certain parts of an app better than others? I would say that these issues reveal all the communication flaws in an org. And so our job as design systems folk isn’t necessarily to fix those bugs as much as it is to tackle the very issues that caused them; miscommunication.
