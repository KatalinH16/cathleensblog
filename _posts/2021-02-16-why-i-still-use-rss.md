> I've already spoken before about my [general disinterest with Social Media](https://atthis.link/blog/2020/mastodon.html) but it wasn't until somewhat recently that I decided to really start looking for alternatives - searching for a better way to interact with the Internet. I found my answer in RSS. I enjoyed the freedom to see sources as I wanted, the flexibility to move to a new reader if I wanted, the complete lack of advertising. It was hard to not fall in love with the service.

By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators etc. that I had a serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life.

On a completely separate tangent here: Marc doesn't share his last name or anything and whenever I see that on the web I'm always impressed. There's an alt-timeline Robin who never shared his name on the web and writes outrageous things about the thoughts in his head via a cool pseudonym like `Infinite Mess` or something I don’t know I haven’t had coffee yet. 

Anyway, this reminds me of two things.

First: a while back I tried to learn more about [Kicks Condor](https://www.kickscondor.com/) and couldn't find anything about whoever makes that site. And it feels so punk rock to me, not having to be known and putting a distance between you and the reader. It feels so very 20th-century-novelist to me. 

And some writers are extremely good at that Sexy Mystery Distance but I think I’m always going to be the opposite end of that spectrum. Blogging is the opposite of all that mystery, in a way.

Second: this reminds me of [Coates’s piece about Kanye and Michael Jackson](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/):

> ...[Kanye] is a god, though one born of a different time and a different need. Jackson rose in the last days of enigma and wonder; West, in an accessible age, when every fuck is a tweet and every defecation a status update. And perhaps, in that way, West has done something more remarkable, more amazing than Jackson, because he is a man of no mystery, overexposed, who holds the world’s attention through simply the consistent, amazing, near-peerless quality of his work.
