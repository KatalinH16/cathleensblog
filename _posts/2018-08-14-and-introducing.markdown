My pal Jez Burrows is working on a new project and a week ago he asked me to help him build what ended up being a lovely teaser site to help promote it a little. It’s called [And Introducing](https://www.jezburrows.com/andintroducing/) and I hope you sign up for the newsletter to learn more in the future.

I really want to spoil the whole thing but all I’ll say for now is read those names in that credit sequence carefully. And don’t forget to sign up for [Adventures](https://buttondown.email/robinrendle) where this weekend I’ll probably dig into the typography decisions that we made a little bit more.
