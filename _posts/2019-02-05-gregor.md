The second episode of Heavyweight by Gimlet called [Gregor](https://www.gimletmedia.com/heavyweight/2-gregor) is lovely and you should listen to it immediately:

> 20 years ago, Gregor lent some CDs to a musician friend. The CDs helped make him a famous rockstar. Now, Gregor would like some recognition. But mostly, he wants his CDs back.

The other day I saw that Gimlet is worth around $200 million and it made no sense to me until I listened to the first thirty seconds of this episode.
