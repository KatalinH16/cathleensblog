extract: The distinction between “a designed system” and “design systems” is an important
  one to make.

I absolutely adore this post by Matthew Ström about [what design systems really are](
https://matthewstrom.com/writing/the-design-system-you-already-have.html) and why they’re so difficult to make. Matthew writes:

> With beautiful design systems like Polaris, Lightning, and Carbon for inspiration, it’s tempting to open up a Sketch file and start your own. A fresh start: all the freedom in the world. Finally, a great-looking date picker.

Your engineering friends can point out the components (what you might call molecules or atoms) and variables (design tokens). Ask the engineers how and why they wrote the code: you’ll hear many of the same concepts that designers use when creating a design system.

I love this sentiment as Matthew argues that there is a system down there, it just wasn’t designed cohesively. But that shouldn’t give us an excuse to start over again or reinvent the wheel.

And on this note, I think people mistake a design system for a _designed_ system — which is an important distinction to make here. Just because this hodgepodge of code and design isn’t cohesively organized and you don’t like it doesn’t mean you can ignore it or start again.

One of the hardest parts about design systems work is that you have to treat it all like designing a blog – the work requires tiny, incremental improvements that build up over time instead of giant reinventions of the wheel that never ship.

“We need a good design system” is like saying “we need a better government” which...sure...but that’s such an impossibly vague and kinda useless thing to say. Instead, we should get to work improving this button, fixing this infrastructure policy, or this particularly gnarly accessibility issue.

I’m so bored of all these design system dudes that seem to think that design is a problem of taste rather than a problem of diligent, slow work over many years – the job isn’t just walking into a room and telling everyone they need more drop shadows.

Likewise I’m bored of how many folks treat design systems as this super cool and sexy work that didn’t exist a couple of years ago. An example? Yesterday I spent all day searching through a million lines of code to find how many instances of the class name “checkbox” exists.

I’m not saying this to dunk on the work – I love my career – but design systems requires a love of unsexy things. And I want to ensure that folks aren’t turned away by all the dudes with nice hair that talk about drop shadows.

People that love spreadsheets – we need you, instead.
