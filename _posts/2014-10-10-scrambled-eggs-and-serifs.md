Here’s an interesting post by [Tobias Frere-Jones](http://www.frerejones.com/blog/scrambled-eggs-and-serifs/) about naming typefaces and how this process has evolved over the ages:

Tobias has only been writing on his blog since April but there’s already a wealth of fantastic articles building up. My favourites include his detective-styled writings on [typographic neighbourhoods](http://www.frerejones.com/blog/my-kind-of-neighborhood/) and his [typewriter collection](http://www.frerejones.com/blog/cryptic-clever-cute/), both of which I’d heartily recommend if you like reading about type history.
