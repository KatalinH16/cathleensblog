extract: Arkady and Boris Strugatsky’s weird and wonderful novel.
---

I would heartily recommend _Roadside Picnic_. It’s a sci-fi novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky and the book’s premise is a wonderful if not entirely ghoulish one: aliens land on Earth but leave without contacting us. In their wake they leave polluted landscapes that the government calls Zones which have been locked off for only a small batch of scientists to explore. But there’s another group called the stalkers that sneak in and steal bits of alien junk and sell it for a fortune. 

If you loved Jeff VanderMeer’s novels _Area X_ or  _Borne_ then it’s obvious from the first page of this book that those were entirely inspired by _Roadside Picnic_. 

This novel was also the inspiration for the 1979 film _Stalker_ directed by Andrei Tarkovsky which was notorious for its hazardous working conditions – they shot the whole film in two days downstream from a nearby chemical plant. And the crazy thing about this is film is how it shows how aliens broke our world but the film is a real recording of environmental devastation in Estonia: it was snowing in summer and poisonous white foam floated down the river during filming which was likely the cause of death for several crew members, including Tarkovsky himself.

Anyway, the reason why I bring this up is because although I haven’t seen the film I have one shot of it imprinted in my mind. I’ve seen this picture so many times that the movie has taken on this mythical, romantic vision in my mind. It’s a photograph of a man standing in a warehouse where the cement floor has bubbled and distorted all around him.
