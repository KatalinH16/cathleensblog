extract: Preserving the web is tough.

[Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/web/digital-longevity/):

> We may be trapped in a web of competing formats, open and closed, standardized and proprietary, single vendor controlled and community driven, available for all and tightly held in app stores and behind walled gardens. We’re trapped in a continuum of open and closed continuously exploited for profit that plays a huge role in the longevity of our digital files.

> Digital content longevity will continue to be highly variable, depending only in part on the file format used. HTML has existed for about 27 years and I wouldn’t venture a guess to say how much longer it’ll go. I can say that a reduction in ceremony around opening and reading a file is better for that file’s longevity. Relatedly, the ubiquity of software necessary to read a file lends to its future proofing as well. And what software has been historically and continues to be more ubiquitous than the lowly web browser? I’m not sure such software exists.

I think about this stuff _a lot_ (just Inspect Element on this here page) but I’m of two minds when it comes to preservation on the web and from day to day I fluctuate between pessimism and optimism. Some days I feel like I’ll be writing HTML and CSS until I retire – I might not be using macOS or even a keyboard or screen to do that, but under the hood it’ll still be HTML and CSS. This feeling becomes more profound when I mess around with Electron and then it’s obvious that _everything_ will be built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript—it’s only a matter of time before we website-ize everything and make those technologies truly ubiquitous. 

But then I think beyond the language and get all sour when I think about [link rot](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/05/25/URI-decay). Even some of the older projects here, like [The New Web Typography](https://robinrendle.com/essays/new-web-typography/), is slowly sinking into the mud. The first thing to stop working was the fonts. Then one day the JavaScript for some of the examples stopped working. 

It’s fascinating actually, watching this enormous project that I cared so much for once slowly rot away back into hypertext. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe one day everything on that page will return to a state of nothing but html tags and responsive text. And maybe it’ll stick around for a while after I’m gone.

But the biggest flaw with all this digital preservation stuff isn’t HTML or CSS in my opinion. _It’s the domain._ We rent spaces on the web and put up our flimsy little flags on top. And then they get lost in a shuffle. Or when someone unplugs something. Or, tragically, if someone dies. Above all things is the part of the web that shows the least amount of resilience.
