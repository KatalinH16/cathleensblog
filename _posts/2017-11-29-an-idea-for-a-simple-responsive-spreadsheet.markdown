At Gusto I’ve been working on a spreadsheet interface that’s a little complicated and elaborate but it got me to wondering how we might build the simplest responsive spreadsheet possible with nothing more than CSS and so I wrote about it for CSS-Tricks.

Here’s an example of the final result: 

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="NwzObg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="robinrendle" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="A Simple Responsive Spreadsheet" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/robinrendle/pen/NwzObg/">A Simple Responsive Spreadsheet</a> by Robin Rendle (<a href="https://codepen.io/robinrendle">@robinrendle</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
