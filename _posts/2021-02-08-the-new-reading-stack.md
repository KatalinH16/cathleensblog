Tom MacWright writes about the current landscape of [reading on the web today](https://macwright.com/2020/12/24/the-new-reading-stack.html): 

> Books are amazing, but the options we have to buy books and track our reading are terrible. A lot of us are locked into the Amazon ecosystem - buying books on Amazon.com, reading them on Kindles. Sites like AbeBooks and Goodreads were quietly acquired by Amazon. Even LibraryThing is now part-owned by Amazon.

Looks like thereâ€™s a lot of exciting ~activity~ in this space though: IndieBound, Bookshop, Book Marks, Italic Type, Open Library. It definitely feels like everyone here is circling around the same ideas and trying to figure out what works best when you combine ~books~ with ~the web~.
