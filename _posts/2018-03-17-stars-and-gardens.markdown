extract: "“The stars align in my garden.”"
---

There’s a song by Jonwayne called *Green Light* where towards the end Anderson Paak takes the reins and sings one of my favorite lines, well, sort of. In his mild mannered and eloquent style he says that “the stars align and my God...” but whenever I listen to that bit I always hear “the stars align in my garden.”

There’s something about that I completely adore, about the misheard version of Paak’s song I mean. Just imagine it. Celestial bodies on the other side of the universe aligning themselves in such a way, even for the briefest of moments. Grouping themselves together into a private space, your home.
