Students at the Plantin Institute of Typography in Antwerp documented their research of the 18th-century Belgian punchcutter Jacques-François Rosart and turned it into a fabulous website called [The Rosart Project](https://www.rosart.nl//). But what’s so interesting here is that the research was treated as a network of publishing projects. First up, students photographed Rosart’s dazzling punches from the North Holland Archives in Haarlem:

...and in the process they wrote a nifty book about the process! But not only that, the team then created revivals of Rosart’s letters, creating a number of lovely fonts. Especially the flourished capitals:

Here’s another punk rock thing: the students all worked towards building a single typographic system. From what I understand, most type courses work like courses of every field: students are effectively in competition with one another, working on their own projects. But this seems like a much healthier way to foster collaboration.

Also the website is fantastic and the fact that they’re treating this course like a publishing project is _fascinating_ to me.  But wait—what’s a revival again? Well, the website notes:

> A revival is based on historical models, made suitable for contemporary use, adapted to the typographical and technical needs of today, but nevertheless relies on a personal response to the historical style.

Ugh. What does any of this mean? The words make sense but it’s written in a style that’s familiar to anyone that reads about the field of typography. It’s what’s known to folks outside the field as bad writing—waffling, unclear, and academic. The word “nevertheless” is a good sign that a paragraph needs to be ejected into the Sun and the whole piece requires a rewrite.

Read this sentence again though because I think it’s extremely important if we want to become good writers, regardless of the field: 
 
> A revival is based on historical models, made suitable for contemporary use, adapted to the typographical and technical needs of today, but nevertheless relies on a personal response to the historical style.

The most damning problems here are technical; it’s difficult to read and it’s unclear. But worse again it’s _boring_. Look at the photographs of Rosart’s work, the book, the type design. Look at the design of the website and how gobsmacking it all is together and then read that sentence one more time:

> A revival is based on historical models, made suitable for contemporary use, adapted to the typographical and technical needs of today, but nevertheless relies on a personal response to the historical style.

There’s no dance, no swagger. There’s nothing playful or insightful here and it functions as most writing does today: simply fulfilling a word count.

Now I know I’m being mean here but I’ve noticed this style of writing bleed into everything from everywhere. The very worst kind of writing is this academic style and then followed shortly after it is the writing found on museum placards. 

Okay, so we get it. The problem is with the words. How do we fix it? How do we avoid falling into the trap of this style?

Well, let’s attempt a rewrite: 

> Type designers will often look at letterforms that were made in the past and then redraw them for modern day use. This is called a revival by the community but I like to think of it as a remix: a type designer will unavoidably apply their own style and harmonies and deviations to the song. Every remix is important, every remix is different. 

It’s not great, but it’s certainly better. There’s not much dance or swagger to it and it’s not High Poetry, but dammit I can now read the thing and I don’t have to, parse, the, thoughts, with, so, many, commas. It feels like the writing has a point of view, with something reasonable to say. 

It sounds like a person is writing to me.

I think this is the most frustrating thing about being interested in typography though. So much of the writing reminds me of Orwell’s [_Politics and the English Language_](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/):

> In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning[2]. Words like _romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality,_ as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, ‘The outstanding feature of Mr. X’s work is its living quality’, while another writes, ‘The immediately striking thing about Mr. X’s work is its peculiar deadness’, the reader accepts this as a simple difference opinion. If words like _black_ and _white_ were involved, instead of the jargon words dead and living, he would see at once that language was being used in an improper way.

I want to underline how much I adore The Rosart Project and I only criticize it because I want to see the whole typographic community break the shackles of this academic style of writing for good. And so here is my advice for type designers: write to swoon, to convince, to make a stranger fall in love. Abandon the academic style. Because it’s making your beautiful work so very boring.
