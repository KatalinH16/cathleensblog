Sometimes I worry that I don’t have the intellectual or creative capacity for certain kinds of design. _Ugh_.

I’ve spent enough time doing design at this point that I can tell if something is good or not. Because when it’s bad I get uncomfortable and I begin to squint at the UI until my brain hurts and I groan. That doesn’t mean that I know how to fix the problem though.

I’ve been in a ton of design crits where I’ve looked at a design, felt that haze of confusion, and unhelpfully said “I don’t think this works but I cannot for the life of me tell you why.” Debugging complex UX decisions on the spot feels like trying to listen to someone speaking Dutch whilst you’re also solving a flexbox issue whilst _also_ learning how to read Aramaic.

Before you ask, I find the problem with a design is never the work of fonts alone. It’s how things are structured, organized, divvied up. How things are bucketed and described. On this note, I remember one time seeing a design manager’s extremely poorly organized spreadsheet and I caught myself thinking _how on earth can I trust you_? How can you possibly be trusted to build a billion dollar web app when you can barely organize text into columns and rows?
