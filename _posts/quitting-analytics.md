Garrett Dimon on [quitting Google analytics](https://garrettdimon.com/2019/quitting-analytics/):

> Some time ago, I removed all the tracking from my personal site, and I haven’t missed it. What started as a whimsical idea that was part performance-based, part referrer spam overload, and part backlash against Google evolved into a realization that analytics aren’t always all that important. Hits. Visits. Likes. Followers. These are easy to measure, but that didn’t make them important.

> I’m more interested in the things I can’t easily quantify.

I only just stumbled upon Garrett’s blog this evening but I realize that I now need a rather long German word for when you discover a website and want to take the week off work and read every last bit of it.
