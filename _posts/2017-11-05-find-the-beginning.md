The NYT has a great post about Emily Wilson’s [new translation of the Odyssey](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html), but here’s a snippet of the opening lines of the poem from [a real good thread](https://twitter.com/catacalypto/status/926359329887764481) that I can’t stop thinking about:

> Tell me about a complicated man.  
Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost  
when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy,  
and where he went, and who he met, the pain  
he suffered in the storms at sea, and how  
he worked to save his life and bring his men  
back home. He failed to keep them safe; poor fools,  
they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god  
kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,  
tell the old story for our modern times.  
Find the beginning.
