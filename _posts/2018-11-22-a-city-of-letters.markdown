I’m reading Gary Kamiya’s *Cool Gray City of Love* at the moment which is a lovely account of the history of San Francisco and it’s architecture, culture, and people. If you’re interested in the history of San Francisco then I’d certainly recommend it. But this week Gary’s book reminded me of an idea I can’t shake for a book of my own.

This idea has been floating about in my head for about two years and it struck me the first moment I laid eyes on San Francisco on an overcast day in December. The city has a peculiar typographic history and a high concentration of people that care intensely about letterforms. 

So whilst Gary’s book traces the history of San Francisco through its geography, mine would trace the history through typography and lettering.

There’s the [Letterform Archive](https://letterformarchive.org/) and Silicon Valley's contribution to typesetting, there’s the [Center for the Book](https://sfcb.org/), [Type Thursday ](https://www.typethursday.org/san-francisco/) and, of course, [New Bohemia Signs](https://www.newbohemiasigns.com/about/) to talk about. There’s desktop publishing and neon lights, the fallow tech industry and it’s lazy branding efforts, there’s the indie type designers and the video games that developed out here.

The book would be a rambling, unfocused, and joyous little thing.

Speaking of which, last week I foolishly took a walk through all the smoke and over into the Mission where I stumbled upon this lovely garage door, designed by a fellow from New Bohemia Signs:

Glorious stuff, huh? Anyway – San Francisco is teeming with typographic artifacts, institutions, and people. I feel like it would make for a wonderful book.

The text would be a mix between the slow, patient waddling of [Futures]((http://robinrendle.com/essays/futures-of-typography) with the upbeat childish whimsy that I hope for in [Adventures](http://robinrendle.com/adventures). It would be more researched and elaborate though and I’d pick an illustrator to help capture that sense of glamour and wonder that I see in the city.

The book would follow me through interviews and trips across the Bay Area where I’d try to make sense of what makes San Francisco special in this regard and what we can learn from this peculiar place.

I think that’s what Adventures has always been really, and if not now then at one point or another; it’s an excuse to write a book.
