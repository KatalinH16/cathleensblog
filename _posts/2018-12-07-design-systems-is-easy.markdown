I love [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=196&v=Y16QDYpj8uI) by [Mina Markham](http://mina.codes) all about her work on designing systems at Slack and Hillary for America. What I particularly love about this talk though is that Mina digs into what she screwed up along the way and how she fixed it. 

I tend to see far too much bragging and hubris in the field of design systems and so itâ€™s wonderful to find someone who is so talented and revered say stuff like this. 

Speaking of which, a while back I had an idea for a talk where I would stand in front of some slides and brag for a whole hour about how great I am at solving design systems problems whilst behind me apocalyptic slides would zoom in and out of view. I think it would be sort of funny so I designed the title card:
