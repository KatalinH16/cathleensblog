extract: A shockingly beautiful thing by Jason Farago.

This is a shockingly beautiful thing by Jason Farago about [art and power](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/02/arts/design/shah-jahan-chitarman.html). Everything about this piece is a delight: the design of the site, the looking-closely-until-it-hurts, the pace and momentum of the writing.

Jason writes about art in the time of Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor. He zooms into one painting and examines every part of it.

But the ending? Yikes:

> ...if you want to last forever, make something beautiful

I know this is bonkers but I can't help but wonder if this piece is somewhat inspired by [Newsletters](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters)? That would be super neat if so.
