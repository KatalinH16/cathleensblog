extract: "“It is a feeling thing, to be a painter of things: cause every thing, even
  an imagined or gone thing or creature or person has essence: paint a rose or a coin
  or a duck or a brick and you’ll feel it as sure as if a coin had a mouth and told
  you what it was like to be a coin...”"

Ali Smith’s potent and luminous novel *How to be both* has been sitting on my desk for several days as I wait to return to it and write something even remotely coherent. But I realize now that will be impossible: *How to be both* is the hand-waving, self-stuttering kind of book where I cannot possibly hold myself back. It’s buoyant and important in the way a good novel always is but for reasons I don’t want to spoil. Instead I want to gurgle and babble, I want to flail the book in the air around my friends nonsensically, I want to speak in tongues and let everyone know that this is a novel that will haunt them. 

Here’s one of the playful tricks of the novel: it is split into two halves and with each printing Ali Smith devilishly switches the order of them; a friend began their copy with the ending of mine and so I feel like we read two entirely separate novels.

Somehow it works, delightfully so.

But which part should I extract for you? Which part describes the book in all its color? I won’t spoil the story at all but I’ll give you a sense of the playfulness in Smith’s writing: she is the sort of writer that requires you *read* and pay attention to the smallest of details. Not in a pedantic, classical way but in the sort that encourages the reader to sit up straight. Smith writes:
