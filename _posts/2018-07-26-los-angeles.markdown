extract: A quick trip down to LA.

The strangest thing about that trip down to LA is that you can see the climate crisis everywhere. You can see it in the political ads that dot the highways; “BUILD DAMS!” they say. “WE NEED WATER” they plead in giant sans-serif letters. You can see the climate crisis in the fields that lead to the horizon which ought to be green but are a Mad Max gold instead. You can sense that the pulses of heat in the air are just a few degrees short of becoming unbearable, unlivable.

California is a paradise, you think as you weave in between comically large trucks on your super cool bad boy motorcycle, and we ruined it.

LA starts with a bang; after a five hour drive on a dead straight road in paralyzing heat you’re suddenly welcomed to the city via a national park and beautiful roads that swoop, duck and peak around the hillsides as if they want you to play with them. And play you do. Your super cool bad boy motorcycle is alert now, he perks up – this is the type of road that he’s been waiting for.

Winding highways that are peculiarly empty lead you through Beverly Hills at dusk. Playboys are driving around in Bugattis and Ferraris but you’re faster, you’re more nimble. With a touch of the throttle you blitz past them all and leave them in your dust.

The next day is your birthday. You wake up, head up through the hills and around Mulholland Drive. You see the urban sprawl and wonder at this thing people have built. It’s not a city, it’s a megacity – a metropolis built around the automobile. You’ve been wondering where all the movie money goes and you turn a corner and you realize that it’s just been plowed back into LA. Hundreds, thousands of mansions and gorgeous homes dot the cliffs and valleys of the surrounding neighbourhood. Something like this in England would be torn down in a heartbeat but out here this flaunting of wealth is somehow inspirational to most people instead of being naturally vile.

After driving around LA all day you realize how poorly the city has been designed for people. Not just because of the highways and cars or even the layout of the buildings. But it’s the heat instead. There’s just no shade anywhere, as either people have gotten used to this or they stay inside their cars and homes where air conditioning is easily found.

It’s impossible to get anywhere without a car in LA but it’s impossible to park anywhere with a car. Thankfully your bike can fit. And it’s free, too. You ride up to the Griffith Observatory and see the haze of pollution that hovers over the city at all times of the day, producing beautiful sunsets of orange and the brightest of pinks.

The next day you’re on the bike again. You’re bored of the heat and since a kid you’ve wanted to drive on the Pacific Coast Highway. First stop: Malibu.

You’re going to drive the whole thing. Fourteen hours, all the way back up to San Francisco, you realize. You smile and push on to the next city; Santa Barbara, then Santa Maria.

Billy (my motorcycle’s temporary name whilst I think of a better replacement) was a fine companion. 

The Pacific Coast Highway, the winding paths that skirt the tip of the ocean and the land, is a famously beautiful road. And it certainly didn’t disappoint. Quite frankly it was the most beautiful ride I’ve ever embarked on.
