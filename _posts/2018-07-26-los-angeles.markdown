extract: A quick trip down to LA.

The strangest thing about that trip down to LA is that you can see the climate crisis everywhere. You can see it in the political ads that dot the highways; “BUILD DAMS!” they say. “WE NEED WATER” they plead in giant sans-serif letters. You can see the climate crisis in the fields that lead to the horizon which ought to be green but are a Mad Max gold instead. You can sense that the pulses of heat in the air are just a few degrees short of becoming unbearable, unlivable.

California is a paradise, you think as you weave in between comically large trucks on your super cool bad boy motorcycle, and we ruined it.

LA starts with a bang; after a four hour drive on a dead straight road in paralyzing heat you’re suddenly welcomed to the city via a national park and beautiful roads that swoop, duck and peak around the hillsides as if they want you to play with them. And play you do. Your super cool bad boy motorcycle is suddenly alert, he perks up, this is the type of road that he’s been waiting for.

Billy (my motorcycle’s temporary name whilst I think of a better replacement) was a fine companion. 

The Pacific Coast Highway, the winding paths that skirt the tip of the ocean and the land, is a famously beautiful road. And it certainly didn’t disappoint. Quite frankly it was the most beautiful ride I’ve ever embarked on.
