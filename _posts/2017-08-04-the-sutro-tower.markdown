extract: In my apartment I’ve positioned my desk by the window facing the tower towards
  the west. In fact I only picked this apartment because of the tower and how it looms
  above Twin Peaks right next door — as soon as I saw this place I knew that this
  is where I would write, by this very window. I knew that I would think of the city
  spinning as I write a million words over the years and that Tower would be my writing
  compatriot, my audience, and the stick that holds it all together.

The San Francisco peninsula often feels as if it’s a plate spinning at a million miles an hour. The culture, the population, the tech boom, they all do their best to keep this plate spinning as fast as it can. But the Sutro Tower, to me at least, is the stick holding it all together and makes sure that the city doesn’t one day break off and twirl into the sky. 

I think about this a great deal because, like a pin hovering over a map, the Sutro Tower is a dominant feature of the Bay Area landscape. Whether you’re sitting in a nondescript office block in downtown San Francisco or sitting on the hills that lie on the outer edges of Oakland and Berkeley to the east over the water, from almost every angle you can see it off in the distance, pinned to the center.
