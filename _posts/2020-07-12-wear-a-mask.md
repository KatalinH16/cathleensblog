I made [this silly thing](https://codepen.io/robinrendle/pen/NWxzJPe) yesterday after I got back from a walk and was feeling rage beyond words:

<p class="codepen" data-height="600" data-theme-id="20935" data-default-tab="result" data-user="robinrendle" data-slug-hash="NWxzJPe" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Wear a mask animation">

  Wear a mask animation</a> by Robin Rendle (<a href="https://codepen.io/robinrendle">@robinrendle</a>)

I’ll be sure to write about how I made it in the [CSS-Tricks newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/newsletters/) which is published every Monday morning. But! This newsletter always has a bunch of hot-takes and/or links to interesting web design things if that’s your jam.
