Just look at this enormous woodblock illustration by Albrecht Dürer made in 1515. From [The Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/388475) archives:

> The Arch of Honor is the artistic summation of Emperor Maximilian I’s ambitions. Combining elements from many of his other commissions, it shows his ancestry, territories, extended kinship, predecessors as emperor, deeds, accomplishments, personal talents, and interests. Among Maximilian’s many ambitious printed projects, the Arch of Honor is the only one that was completed and published during his lifetime. The full visual and textual monument comprises 36 sheets of large folio paper printed from 195 woodblocks.
