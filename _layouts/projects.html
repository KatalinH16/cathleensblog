  <h2>The Transfers App • Gusto</h2>

  <p>Gusto is a payroll, benefits and <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> platform and I worked on the payroll team. My task there was to design and develop a number of payroll features for the ~65,000 companies that ran payrolls of more than $4.7 billion dollars in total during a single year.</p>
  <p>One of my favorite projects was researching, designing and developing the Transfers app; this was an internal tool that was used to onboard particularly large companies that wanted to run payroll with Gusto.</p>
  <p>Let’s say that your company has 15 employees and you’d like to switch to using Gusto as your payroll provider. Well, first you would have to contact Transfers: this is a team of twenty or so people at Gusto that would take all of your company information (such as <abbr title="Federal Employer Identification Number">FEIN</abbr>, work locations, and pay schedules) as well as all of the paystubs for every employee since the beginning of the year and transfer it into Gusto’s system. This is quite frankly an overwhelming amount of information that was taking too much time and was extremely frustrating. So I was brought onto the project to research and build a potential solution for the team that would improve their efficiency and general happiness.</p>

  <h4>Researching the Problem</h4>
  <p>M research consisted of talking to team members on the payroll team, the Transfers team and also the Sales team. Understanding the relationship between these groups of people was vital before I could start making any sense of the problem.</p>
  <p>Before I made the trip to the Gusto offices in Denver I thought this project would be a simple one, however it wasn’t until I sat down with several members of the Transfers team and watched them work that it became obvious just how difficult and nuanced this project would become.</p>
  <p>Here are the main points that I discovered during this research phase:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The team had problems with remembering the status of company, for example they would ask themselves questions such as “Have I entered the <abbr title='Social Security Number'>SSN</abbr>s of all employees?”, “Have I entered all of the paystubs for this company?” or even “What is the deadline for this transfer?” This could be particularly challenging when one of the team members that was handling transfers became sick or if there was a looming deadline for a company transfer to be completed.</li>
    <li>Historical paystub entry was extraordinarily difficult because it required a lot of knowledge around the various different types of contributions and benefits, as well as the type of employee (whether they’re dismissed, currently employeed or a contractor).</li>
    <li>Information would frequently get lost between the customer and our Sales, Transfers and Care teams. This led to all sorts of frustrating issues such as data being deleted or overridden which would then slow the transfer process immensely.</li>
    <li>Accessibility was a huge problem. The team used an internal tool called Panda that was used by a large number of teams across Gusto. However, because it wasn’t designed specifically for the Transfers team to onboard customers they would spend a large amount of time scrolling and clickign their way through this app in order to find or input the information they needed. The Transfers team would often login to the primary app (the customer-facing interface) in order to input data but this was not streamlined for them or their needs.</li>
    <li>Inputting historical paystubs for every employee of a company and adding their benefits was particularly painful and slow because of several <abbr title="User interface">UI</abbr> issues such as form elements not being tabbable.</li>
  </ul>

    <figcaption>
      <p>I began wireframing the data structure of their process, starting with the data that was required of a companies employees (such as first name, surname, home address and <abbr title="Social security numbers">SSN</abbr>s).</p>

    <figcaption>
      <p>By ensuring that only the most important data would be entered by the team I moved from this data from the whiteboard to a spreadsheet so we could share this with the rest of the team and get feedback.</p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The Transfer team’s job was only complete when they had entered all of the necessary data and the first payroll of a company had been run, so I made extensive lists of every bit of information that they needed to enter manually from another payroll provider (such as Paychex or Intuit).</p>
  <p>The team had two methods of inputting data: through the confusing and muddled Panda internal app, or through the customer-facing application. Neither were good options because for each bit of information that was entered they were forced to enter a single paystub or a single employee at a time. For example there were also bits of info that the app required but was not required to run payroll quickly. A profile photo was required for an employee for example, but that would get in the way of the Transfers’ team goal: to get payroll setup as quickly as possible.</p>

  <h4>Proposed Solutions</h4>
  <p>Based on this research I devised a plan for attack:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A new application: designed solely for the Transfers team would optimize the <abbr title='User Experience'>UX</abbr> + <abbr title='User Interface'>UI</abbr> for their needs and would also prevent any conflicts if the tool had any impact on Panda (and thereby impacting teams in other parts of the company).</li>
    <li>Focus on batch-editing data: adding historical paystub and employee data requires a lot of manual data entry and so anything that common properties between paystubs or employees should be assigned automatically or set quickly for everyone.</li>
    <li>Create a to-do list: this would help clearly identify the status of a transfer.</li>
    <li>Give the transfer team member the ability to lock/unlock the customer account: this will prevent data to be overriden during the onboarding process accidentally by a customer.</li>
    <li>Only provide the info that they need: we needed to limit the number of fields to only those that block payroll so that their time is best spent on the complex parts of the work.</li>
    <li>Design a strong feedback loop and communication mechanism: one between a company admin, the Transfers team and Sales. Potentially in app, so that they don’t have to use Slack or email for more information about a transfer.</li>
    <li>Gather the data and order it correctly: some of the onboarding steps at Gusto require to be entered before others (for example, certain taxes can be assigned to employees only after it’s clear which states that a company has offices in).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>These issues were then discussed with the Transfers team and with the enginerring lead on this project in order to get a sense of whether these goals were realistic.</p>

  <h4>Early Wireframes</h4>
  <p>All projects are different but because I was starting a new app from scratch I knew that I should spend most of my time working on lo-fidelity mocks — specifically in Balsamiq.app. I could then depend on the components from Gusto’s design system that I had been building for the last two years and could thereby skip the hi-fidelity mockup phase altogether.</p>
  <p>
    After discussing the plan above with the engineering team, and confirming those priorities with the Transfers team, we decided on tackling the to-do list and Employee (or using the Gusto nomanclature <em>People</em>) data entry first.

      <p>
        These were the mockups I used as a barebones prototype to test with the Transfers team. I discovered during the research phase that the 3 different employee types (currently employed, dismissed and contractors) all required different information attached to them for tax and payroll purposes so I devised a page where all employees could be batch edited and ultimately where a Transfers team member could focus on one type before moving onto the next one.
      </p>

  <p>
    A member of the team would be assigned a company to transfer via Salesforce and the Sales team at Gusto, so I knew that we could piggyback of this existing process. By clicking the company link they would be sent to a page in Panda that contained all the information about the company, however it was extremely confusing and wouldn’t let them edit any of the data. So in my design I changed that paradigm with a much more efficient one: a link in Salesforce would send them directly into a to-do list that would show them which bits of information had already been entered and where they had to get started.

  <h3>Metrics for Success</h3>

  <h3>What wasn’t successful about this project</h3>

  <h3>What I learned during this project</h3>

  <h3>Interesting Stats</h3>
  <p>I think we add 1500 - 2000 clients every month…Payroll transfers numbers are usually 100-150 per month…so about 5-10% of total adds are through transfers.</p>
