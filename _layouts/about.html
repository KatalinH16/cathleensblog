      <p>My name’s Robin and I’m a web designer from the south west of England. Now I live in cloudy San Francisco where I work as a product designer at
      <a href='https://gusto.com'>Gusto</a>. My day job is spent building our design system, contributing to the foundations of our front-end codebase and working on the underlying <abbr>UX</abbr> of the application.</p>

      <p>I also write, edit and publish things alongside the team at <a href='http://css-tricks.com'>CSS-Tricks</a>. Although most of my time is now spent on <a href='http://css-tricks.com/newsletter'>the newsletter</a> where we collect everything that happened in this little community over the course of any given week. So if you’re interested in front-end development then I’d highly recommend you sign up.</p>

      <p>Partly inspired by <a href='https://chriscoyier.net/timeline/'>Chris’</a> and <a href='http://zachjohnston.com/'>Zach’s</a> timelines, here’s a list of events that were really important for me and my career in web design:</p>

          <div class='about-block flex flex-align-baseline u-reset-margins rules--top rules--bottom rules--light cell-t20 cell-b20'>
            <div class='cell-r15 h6 c-lightgrey'>10/2008</div>
            <div class='about-text'>
              Started my undergrad degree at Plymouth University in English Literature.
            </div>
            <div class='about-hidden'>
              I almost flunked out of university because I spent so much time writing music and then at the last moment I was obsessed with writing a ten thousand word epic poem about Bethlehem asylum.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='about-block flex flex-align-baseline u-reset-margins rules--bottom rules--light cell-t20 cell-b20'>
            <div class='cell-r15 h6 c-lightgrey'>10/2011</div>
            <div class='about-text'>
              Studied an MA in Information Design at the prestigious and scary Department of Typography and Graphic Communication at Reading University.
            </div>
            <div class='about-hidden'>
              Kinda had my ego thrown into the heart of the nearest star when I suddenly discovered that design is more than nice fonts and pretty colors.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='about-block flex flex-align-baseline u-reset-margins rules--bottom rules--light cell-t20 cell-b20'>
            <div class='cell-r15 h6 c-lightgrey'>02/2012</div>
            <div class='about-text'>
              Worked with the writer/editor Alex Charchar on <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/the-journey-from-writer-to-reader/'>my first piece</a> for Smashing Magazine.
            </div>
            <div class='about-hidden'>
               It was a long and grueling process because I was learning how to write and design at the same time. I remember one moment where Alex was trying desperately to teach me about contrast in photography and it just wouldn’t sink in.
