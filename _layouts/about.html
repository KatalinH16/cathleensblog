      <p>I’m a web designer from the south west of England and now I live in cloudy San Francisco where I work as a product designer at
      <a href='https://gusto.com'>Gusto</a>. My day job is spent building our design system, contributing to the foundations of our front-end codebase and working on the underlying <abbr>UX</abbr> of the application.</p>

      <p>I also write, edit and publish things alongside the team at <a href='http://css-tricks.com'>CSS-Tricks</a>. Although most of my time is now focused on <a href='http://css-tricks.com/newsletter'>the newsletter</a> where we collect everything that happened in this little community over the course of any given week. So if you’re interested in front-end development then I’d highly recommend you sign up.</p>

      <!-- <p>Partly inspired by <a href='https://chriscoyier.net/timeline/'>Chris’</a> and <a href='http://zachjohnston.com/'>Zach’s</a> timelines, here’s a list of events that were really important for me and my career in web design:</p>

                Almost flunked out of university because I spent so much time writing music and then at the last moment I was obsessed with making a website for my band, so I taught myself <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>.

                In the tiny hallways of the Department of Typography and Graphic Communication I had my ego torn out of my chest and thrown into the nearest star — it was here I discovered that design is more than nice fonts and pretty colors.

                 I worked alongside the writer/editor/designer <a href='http://retinart.net/'>Alex Charchar</a> and the process was a long and grueling one because I was learning how to write and design at the same time. I remember one moment where Alex was trying desperately to teach me about contrast in photography and it just wouldn’t sink in. Oof, sorry Alex.

              </div>
              <div class='about-hidden'>
                 It was here that I learned about the command-line and front-end development and attending to the smallest of details when it comes to code.

              </div>
              <div class='about-hidden'>
                I still write for CSS-Tricks and yet I’m kinda sorta still terrified of how smart and brilliant and kind the team is.
