[Shift Happens](https://shifthappens.site) is a book about keyboards and, for the launch of [his Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mwichary/shift-happens?ref=av4ohi), I was lucky enough to interview Marcin. My role here was just to ask the questions, look handsome, and gasp at how punk rock his book had become after all these years.
