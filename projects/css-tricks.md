[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) is a popular front-end website by Chris Coyier and in 2014 I joined the team to write about the latest developments in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

    <figcaption><a href="https://css-tricks.com/redirect-web-page/"><div>How to redirect a web page</a> was the first piece I wrote and it was completely terrifying. I’d never written anything that required careful step-by-step instructions before but thankfully Chris was the best mentor; his guidance was sharp and funny and kind.</div></figcaption>

    <figcaption><div>There’s a lot of concepts in CSS that are hard to grok with words alone, and so experimenting with these CSS properties in Codepen became real important. Here’s another demo about the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-backdrop-filter-css-property/">backdrop-filter</a> property that made it click for me.</div></figcaption>

    <figcaption>Each Sunday I also wrote the newsletter that went out to more than 90,000 readers at one point. It was a great place to summarize all the drama in the front-end world and experience writing on a tight deadline.</figcaption>

    <figcaption><div>When Chris sold CSS-Tricks to Digital Ocean in early 2022, I wrote a piece about <a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/an-ode-to-css-tricks/">what those eight years meant for me</a>, and left shortly after since the timing felt right. But—dang—what a ride. I couldn’t be happier with the opportunity to write alongside such a great team of writers and editors.
