<p class="intro">Sentry notifications could only be sent to email or Slack which caused a lot of important messages to be missed. These concepts explored how in-app notifications might help.</p>

After interviewing customers I heard many complaints that important Sentry updates were being lost via email or drowned out in Slack. Not only that but when new features shipped or new company posts were published, customers would tell me that they never knew Sentry could do that one neat thing.

So I mocked up a few concepts for notifications that could be seen, dismissed, and taken action on from within the Sentry web app itself. In the first concept I explored a summary of the last few days worth of notifications. In the second, I explored how we could redesign the app to make notifications, search, and the what’s new section easier to navigate.

Searching through Sentry’s documentation from within the app itself was buried pretty deep and so this would’ve potentially answered a few support questions as well as tackling the notification problem. In these concepts, search would pull in results from the Sentry blog for new features, the documentation website with setup information, and quick links to advanced settings.
