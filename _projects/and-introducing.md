subtitle: A microsite for a wonderful little art book.
extract: I made a quick microsite for Jez Burrows’ new Kickstarter campaign and art
  book, _And Introducing_. Jez describes this peculiar thing as “an art book that
  collects over 2,500 unlikely, unfortunate, or unintelligible casting credits from
  almost a century of cinema history.” The book ends up being wonderfully funny and
  strange when you read that someone in a real honest-to-goodness movie was credited
  as playing ‘Reluctant Surgeon’ or ‘Dank Jimmy.’
role: Front-end development, design
results: An animated website marketing the book

Jez came to me with the pitch: he wanted us to build a microsite that would market his book and he wanted it to imitate the scroll of an end-of-movie credits sequence. So we paired on it and after a couple of hours we had something that looked pretty fun and interesting and in my opinion added to the peculiar comedy of the book’s content.
