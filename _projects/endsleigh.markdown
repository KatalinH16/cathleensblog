extract: 'Endsleigh is a student insurance provider in the <abbr>UK</abbr> and I worked
  with them to develop a framework capable of supporting their vast array of products

  maintained by their internal team of developers, designers and project managers.

## Project Goals

1. An easy-to-read codebase with a strong foundation on object-oriented <abbr title='cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr>.
2. Make the website as accessible for as many customers and users as possible.
3. Create a performance budget that prioritised speed over hi-fidelity visual design.

As a front-end developer I worked closely with the head of design at Erskine and the lead front-end developer to break down the design mockups into an ellaborate system of components and templates. Throughout the project we discussed ways in which to cut down on the number of components and re-use them as much as possible. We also constantly discussed ways in which to change the design in order to improve the performance of the website (such as stripping out unnecessary images and replacing them with inline <abbr title='scalable vector graphics'>SVG</abbr>s). That feedback loop between design and development ultimately taught me an awful lot about how a team ought to collaborate and work together in the future.

But we had several interesting constraints: the most important being the mobile-first design, but shortly followed by the need to ensure that the website worked just as well in IE8 and IE9 as it did in the latest versions of Chrome. This is because of our initial research into the analytics of their old website where we found that even though Endsleigh is a student insurance provider with a young group of customers, they still had a large percentage of customers that were using older browsers. So this had to be taken into account for everything that we designed and built in the months to follow.


## Starting the Design System

First we took a look at the high-fidelity mockups, printed them out and plastered them over the wall, closely examining how we might break them up into tiny blocks of <abbr title='cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> and <abbr title='hypertext markup language'>HTML</abbr>. This was a new method of working on front-end development for me and seeing a website in this manner but after just a few minutes it was possible to spot the similarities and differences between everything.

It was around this time that we also set rigorous performance budgets and talked with the design team often when particular components needlessly hindered the frame rate or slowed the website to a crawl. A small part of this performance work was ensuring that our Sass code didnâ€™t bloat the compiled <abbr title='cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> output, but our main focus was spent on ways in which to reduce the total number of images on the site.

Serving <abbr title='scalable vector graphics'>SVG</abbr> assets and high resolution images was important because of the growing number of mobile devices that were being used to access the site, but we also took steps to protect users from downloading multiple versions of each asset in order to keep our performance budget intact.

## Project Review

This was one of the first large-scale projects that I ever worked on and it was a very important one since it taught me how to think in systems and relationships when it comes to writing a lot of <abbr title='cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> that might conflict with another component. It made me deeply concerned and excited about usability, mobile design, and web performance, too.
