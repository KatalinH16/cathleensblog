Endsleigh is a student insurance provider and I worked with them to develop a framework capable of supporting their vast array of products and services, focusing specifically on object oriented <abbr title='Cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> and performance.

The site uses a number of features that older browsers don’t support, but because of the current analytics we needed to provide safe fallbacks. Each component was designed to have progressively enhanced features so that IE8+9 users still had a great experience overall.

We set rigorous performance budgets and talked with the design team when particular components needlessly hindered the frame rate or slowed the website to a crawl. A great part of this was ensuring that our Sass code didn’t bloat the compiled CSS output.

Serving SVG assets and high resolution images was important because of the growing number of mobile devices that were being used to access the site, but we also took steps to protect users from downloading multiple versions of each asset in order to keep our performance budget intact.
