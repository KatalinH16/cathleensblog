subtitle: Creating design documentation for Gusto’s designers in Figma.
dateRange: November 2017 – November 2018
role: Design and front-end development of the time tracking feature.
results: High quality front-end code and documentation for the components and assets,
  such as logos, illustrations, and icons.
extract: 'The Guide is a web app that documents Gusto’s ever-growing design system
  and my goal was to create a tool that anyone at the company could turn to when looking
  for information about the React components, baseline styles, as well as the overall
  brand and voice of the company. I broke this work up intro three distinct categories:
  educating designers and developers, documenting the existing system for future use,
  and implementing new features and components into our applications.'

Mobile was a top priority from the beginning of this project
