subtitle: Creating design documentation for Gusto’s designers in Figma.
dateRange: November 2018 – January 2019
role: Built the UI Kit from the ground up.
results: High quality documentation for Gusto’s design patterns and components.
extract: At Gusto the design team uses Figma to make mockups and prototypes of new
  features as well as wireframes for potential improvements to be made. I noticed
  that there were a lot of discrepancies between what designers were making and what
  engineers would implement so I made a UI Kit to improve communication between teams.

## Improving the designer experience at Gusto

Once a part of the design system had been refactored or built from the ground up I could then begin to document it in the Guide to ensure that sort of information wouldn’t be siloed away or kept hidden from others in the company. But one of the more interesting aspects of the work besides writing documentation for developers at Gusto was the time I spent improving the designer experience.

The design team at Gusto uses the design web app Figma to make mockups and prototypes and, in some cases, even to flesh out specs for how a product should ultimately be built. Designers then share these documents with project managers, engineers, and stake holders with ease.

This encouraged me to build a number of our React page templates, components, icons and form elements in the Figma pattern library so that they could then be shared immediately across missions and teams — it was extraordinarily helpful for our design team specifically because we no longer had to keep rebuilding the same elements over and over again for every project.

         With these new tools in Figma we could quickly make mockups of high-fidelity user interfaces for testing and prototyping.
