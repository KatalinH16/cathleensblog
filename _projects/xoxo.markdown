I worked alongside Andy McMillan and Andy Baio of [XOXO](http://twitter.com/xoxo) fame to help build [a teaser](http://xoxopdx.com) for their upcoming artist space in Portland alled the Outpost. In a blog post describing the project in [a little more detail](http://blog.xoxofest.com/post/120703410510/a-new-experiment), the two Andys write:

> We hope to bring together some of our favorite people and projects in indie art and tech under one roof, as well as a handful of startups working on tools that help people stay independent. And, of course, we’re ridiculously excited to have our own space to run weird and wonderful events year-round.

Considering this project was a very short, single page advertisement, I thought it was best to immediately jump into [Codepen](http://codepen.io) to come up with some ideas for the design. That way everyone could pick at the work from a browser instead of sorting through a constant stream of mockups and navigating around frustrating conversations via email or Basecamp. Relatedly, I think that sometimes showing a client a rough sketch of a design and letting them freely say “that’s not right because X, Y, Z” is the preferred path over grinding them with questions and expecting coherent, timely answers from pixel-perfect mockups. But I’d only recommend this approach so long as you’re comfortable with the fact that the first draft of a design will be entirely, 100% wrong. You also have to be ok with the fact that you’re writing prototype code at this stage and so the codebase is very likely to be useless once you get around to building the site for real.

I initially experimented with a darker color palette and overall design language for the site, with lots of animations and twisting, turning `canvas` elements. However, it was pretty obvious that this wasn’t the right decision but because we were designing everything in the browser it was easy to reverse early decisions and play with the code to move the project forward.

In February 2016 we launched the second version of the website that was designed to advertise the space and capture the details of those that might be interested. This work involved a new color scheme and general overall style to attract as much attention as possible. Typographically we also shifted away from the previous monospace font and chose something a little more neutral and understated.

Here’s a video of the final website that was built after the teaser:
