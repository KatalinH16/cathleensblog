subtitle: Writing for CSS-Tricks about web design and front-end development.
extract: Since early 2015 I’ve been a regular contributor to [<abbr title='Cascading
  style sheets'>CSS</abbr>-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), a website by [Chris Coyier](http://twitter.com/chriscoyier)
  that sets out to document front-end technology and provide tutorials and links to
  help developers learn more about the web. Over the years I’ve written a number of
  articles and tutorials that explore new browser features and written in-depth articles
  on the peculiarities of <abbr title='Cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr>, JavaScript
  and HTML. Quite frankly it’s been a wonderful opportunity to improve my front-end
  and writing skills as well as work with some of the smartest people in the industry.
role: Writing, pitching, and editing articles and contributions.
results: 'Growing the newsletter to more than 32,000 subscribers and constantly learning about the latest and greatest in front-end development.'

Over that time I've written about [a variety of topics](https://css-tricks.com/author/robinrendle/), but my favourite part of working with the team is the writing process. First, I take a look at a property such as `background-blend-mode` where either I update the Almanac entry or [make a new one](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/). From there I’ll make a series of demos to figure out how it works whilst reading up on what other people have already made with it. Sometimes this work will lead to me [finding something new](https://css-tricks.com/chaining-multiple-blend-modes/) that you can do with a <abbr title='cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> property or it encourages interesting ideas for future <abbr title='user interface'>UI</abbr> explorations in my day job.

Not only has working with the excellent team been an inspiration, they’ve also taught me a great deal about copywriting, front-end development, and design. Here’s a sample of posts that I’ve written over the years that I’m particularly fond of:

Here are a couple of demos I’ve made whilst I was writing and researching those articles about front-end development:

## The Weekly Newsletter

Currently I spend most of my time writing [the weekly newsletter](http://css-tricks.com/newsletter) which collects everything that was posted on the website during the week and then wrap things up with a comment about what I’ve been learning about that week. Sometimes it’s about code, but it’s often about topics that are related to front-end development, such as managing large teams of front-end engineers.

Collaborating with Chris and a few other guest writers for the newsletter, we’ve grown it from zero subscribers to more than 32,000 which is sort of scary, intimidating and exciting all at the same time.
