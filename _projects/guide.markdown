The Guide is a web app designed for the designers, developers and product managers at Gusto that I designed an

In the introduction to the Guide I described the project like this:

> This is where all of the documentation for Gusto’s design system is archived for safe keeping; it contains all the assets you need, such as images and illustrations as well as notes on our copywriting style and documentation for our React components. In fact, we like to think of *The Guide* as a sort of Pokédex.
>
> Ideally this is where we can share information and collaborate in a public space to gain consensus across missions in terms of code, design, accessibility, performance and branding. If we improve a single component here in The Guide then all of our apps and features will reap the rewards at the same time in a predictable manner.

## Project Goals

1. Set high standards for design and front-end development at Gusto.
2. Reduce miscommunication across teams around how to use the React components.
3. Greatly reduce the amount of design inconsistencies in the app.

The goals of this project could then really be neatly separated into two buckets: *education* and *implementation*. Since before I started at Gusto there was no design systems team or dedicated front-end engineers there were a large number of code problems.

My role in this project was to lead the documentation, refactoring and visual design improvements for our design team across the various missions at Gusto.

## Projects I Worked On for the Guide

1. Typography refactor: font-sizes, styles and hierarchy.
2. Refactored our icon fonts and creating a plan for the future.
3. Wrote CSS guidelines to train other team members about maintainable code.
4. Created several components that were then used across <abrr title='Engineering, product and design'>EPD</abbr> missions.

### What I learnt from this project

I learned that tools will only help so much in improving the design quality of a large scale web app. Tools that help us make design systems sure are useful, and will do a lot of the work but ultimately it’s down to the shape of the organization. *Design systems is not a tooling problem, it’s a people problem.* And so I spent a great deal of time trying to pair with and mentor designers that were not quite as familiar with front-end development and systems-thinking as I am.
