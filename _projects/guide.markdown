<h4>Launching the app</h4>
<p>
  Section about the finished implementation of the app – the to-do list especially.
</p>


<h3>Metrics for Success</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Our team decreased the amount of time it took to transfer a company by more than 33%.</li>
  <li>It takes 4.76 minutes to create a new employee through Dabba Tabba, compared to 12.4 minutes "the old way."</li>
  <li>67% (1,510) of all employees transferred since Since December 15, 2017 have been entered through Dabba Tabba. The following week 77% of all employees transferred were entered through the Transfers app.</li>
  <li>In one month 2,714 employees had been added to Gusto via Transfers app.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What wasn’t successful about this project</h3>

<h3>Interesting Stats</h3>
<p>I think we add 1500 - 2000 clients every month…Payroll transfers numbers are usually 100-150 per month…so about 5-10% of total adds are through transfers.</p>
