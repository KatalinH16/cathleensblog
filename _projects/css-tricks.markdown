subtitle: Writing for the CSS-Tricks community about front-end development.
extract: |
  Since early 2015 I’ve been a regular contributor to [<abbr title='Cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr>-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), a publication by [Chris Coyier](http://twitter.com/chriscoyier) that sets out to document front-end technology and provide tutorials and links to help developers learn more about the web. Over those years I’ve written a number of technical posts that explore new browser features and written in-depth tutorials on the peculiarities of <abbr title='Cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> and JavaScript.
role: Writing, editing, and making code demos.
results: Growing the newsletter from zero subscribers to more than 32,000 over the course of a year.

This has led to me exploring [a variety of topics](https://css-tricks.com/author/robinrendle/), but my favourite part of working with the team is the writing process. First, I take a look at a property such as `background-blend-mode` where either I update the Almanac entry or [make a new one](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/). From there I’ll make a series of demos to figure out how it works whilst reading up on what other people have already made with it.

Not only has working with the excellent team been an inspiration it’s also taught me a great deal about copywriting, front-end development and design. Sometimes my work has lead to me [finding something new](https://css-tricks.com/chaining-multiple-blend-modes/) that you can do with a <abbr title='cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> property or it encourages interesting ideas for <abbr title='user interface'>UI</abbr>.

Here are some of my favorite posts that I’ve written over the years:

- [Tools for Thinking and Tools for Systems](https://css-tricks.com/tools-thinking-tools-systems)
- [Getting Started with CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/getting-started-css-grid)
- [An Idea for a Simple Responsive Spreadsheet](https://css-tricks.com/idea-simple-responsive-spreadsheet)


## The Weekly Newsletter

Currently I spend most of my time writing [the weekly newsletter](http://css-tricks.com/newsletter) which collects everything that was posted on the website during the week and then wrap things up with a comment about what I’ve been learning about that week. Sometimes it’s about code, but it’s often about topics that are related to front-end development, such as managing large teams of front-end engineers.

Colloborating with Chris and a few other guest writers for the newsletter, we’ve grown it from zero subscribers to more than 32,000 which is sort of scary, intimidating and exciting all at the same time.
