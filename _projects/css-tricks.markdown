Since February 2015 I’ve been a regular contributor to [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), a publication by [Chris Coyier](http://twitter.com/chriscoyier) that sets out to document front-end technology and provide tutorials and links to help developers learn more about the web. Over the past few years I’ve written technical posts that explore new browser features and written in-depth tutorials on the peculiarities of <abbr title='Cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> and JavaScript.

This has led to me exploring [a variety of topics](https://css-tricks.com/author/robinrendle/), but my favourite part of working with the team is the writing process. First, I take a look at a particular property like `background-blend-mode` where either I update the Almanac entry or [make a new one](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/). From there I’ll make a series of demos to figure out how it works whilst reading up on what other people have already made with it. Sometimes this will lead to me [finding something new](https://css-tricks.com/chaining-multiple-blend-modes/) that you can do with this property or coming up with [new interface ideas](https://css-tricks.com/reverse-text-color-mix-blend-mode/).
