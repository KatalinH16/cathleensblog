subtitle: Writing for the CSS-Tricks community about web design and front-end development.
extract: 'Since early 2015 I’ve been a regular contributor to [<abbr title=''Cascading
  style sheets''>CSS</abbr>-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), a publication by [Chris
  Coyier](http://twitter.com/chriscoyier) that sets out to document front-end technology
  and provide tutorials and links to help developers learn more about the web. Over
  those years I’ve written a number of technical posts and tutorials that explore
  new browser features and written in-depth articles on the peculiarities of <abbr
  title=''Cascading style sheets''>CSS</abbr>, JavaScript and HTML. It’s been a wonderful
  opportunity to improve my front-end skills as well as hopefully contributing something
  back to the community. '
role: Writing, pitching, and editing contributions.
results: 'Growing the newsletter to more than 32,000 subscribers and constantly learning
  about the latest and greatest in front-end development.

Over that time I've written about [a variety of topics](https://css-tricks.com/author/robinrendle/), but my favourite part of working with the team is the writing process. First, I take a look at a property such as `background-blend-mode` where either I update the Almanac entry or [make a new one](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/). From there I’ll make a series of demos to figure out how it works whilst reading up on what other people have already made with it. Sometimes this work will lead to me [finding something new](https://css-tricks.com/chaining-multiple-blend-modes/) that you can do with a <abbr title='cascading style sheets'>CSS</abbr> property or it encourages interesting ideas for future <abbr title='user interface'>UI</abbr> explorations in my day job.

Not only has working with the excellent team been an inspiration, they’ve also taught me a great deal about copywriting, front-end development, and design. Here’s a sample of posts that I’ve written over the years that I’m particularly fond of:

- [Tools for Thinking and Tools for Systems](https://css-tricks.com/tools-thinking-tools-systems)
- [Getting Started with CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/getting-started-css-grid)
- [An Idea for a Simple Responsive Spreadsheet](https://css-tricks.com/idea-simple-responsive-spreadsheet)
- [A New Responsive Font Format for the Web](https://css-tricks.com/a-new-responsive-font-format-for-the-web/)
- [Loading fonts with the Web Font Loader](https://css-tricks.com/loading-web-fonts-with-the-web-font-loader/)
- [Making Charts with CSS](https://css-tricks.com/making-charts-with-css/)
- [A Quick Overview of Object Fit and Object Position](https://css-tricks.com/on-object-fit-and-object-position/)
- [Chaining Multiple Blend Modes](https://css-tricks.com/chaining-multiple-blend-modes/)

## The Weekly Newsletter

Currently I spend most of my time writing [the weekly newsletter](http://css-tricks.com/newsletter) which collects everything that was posted on the website during the week and then wrap things up with a comment about what I’ve been learning about that week. Sometimes it’s about code, but it’s often about topics that are related to front-end development, such as managing large teams of front-end engineers.

Collaborating with Chris and a few other guest writers for the newsletter, we’ve grown it from zero subscribers to more than 32,000 which is sort of scary, intimidating and exciting all at the same time.
