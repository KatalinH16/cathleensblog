As I sit here in this fabulously raucous café though, reading a real-life book about the web, I find myself cheering quietly to myself. And I can’t stop smiling.</p><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">I’m reading Tim Brown’s <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/flexible-typesetting" class="astro-Mc0GBvIe"><em class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">Flexible Typesetting</em></a> and I realize it should be the textbook definition for the word <em class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">enthusiasm</em> itself. And it’s one of those rare examples of a book that’s overwhelmingly charming from start to finish. In fact it’s the sort of book that reminds you that the web is a precious thing worth building, and that the web is, and can still be, ours for the making.</p><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe"><em class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">Flexible Typesetting</em> is a book about how the web has fundamentally changed the art of typesetting and the best practices that designers have followed for hundreds of years. In the introduction Tim writes:</p><blockquote class="astro-Mc0GBvIe"><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">…the web has catalyzed the single biggest change in typographic history — a change that has profoundly affected not only the experience of reading but also the practice of designing that experience: typesetting.</p><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">Granted, typography and typesetting have changed before. These practices have existed for centuries, over which time new technologies, new media, and new ideas have bloomed, flourished, and withered. […] However, the web is neither a new technology, nor a new medium, nor a new idea; the web represents an evolutionary step for all technologies, all media, and all ideas.</p></blockquote><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">This is thanks to the sheer number of devices and experiences that are possible when someone views a website we’ve typeset. They could be reading it on a 2G or 3G network, they could be reading our websites in the dark on their phone, on large billboards from a great distance, or on the dashboards of their cars. Because of these infinitely variable conditions, Tim argues that typography on the web is only a suggestion and rather than us truly understanding our designs, he argues that we’re building experiences “by manipulating their shadows” instead.</p><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">Tim opens up the first chapter with another one-two punch:</p><blockquote class="astro-Mc0GBvIe"><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">Typography may now be optional, but that doesn’t mean it’s worthless. Typographic choices contribute to a text’s meaning. But on the web, text itself (including its structural markup) matters most, and presentational instructions like typography take a back seat. Text loads first; typography comes later.</p></blockquote><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">Although many designers will flinch at this lack of control, I think it’s rather something to be inspired by. It differentiates the web from everything else and makes text on the web special, universal, accessible to everyone. And I think that Tim makes the case in this book that I’ve been thinking about for a long time, about the connection between text and design and how you can’t really do the text justice if you don’t care about it.</p><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">Or, as Tim puts it rather more succinctly:</p><blockquote class="astro-Mc0GBvIe"><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">The better you know your text, the better your typesetting will be.</p></blockquote><p class="astro-Mc0GBvIe">So! I would highly recommend that you go and pick up your own copy of the book as there’s a lot of interesting information in there around how to build outstanding, resilient, and wondrously typographic interfaces for the web.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
