Let’s begin:</p><hr class="astro-mMfkrxN3"><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Freelance work is starting to gain traction, at least according to the data I’m seeing from <a href="http://cushionapp.com/" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Cushion</a>, a great tool for freelancers which helps me track the projects I’m currently working on. Even though it’s described as a paid beta, there’s little about the service that gives you that impression. The writing is clear and consistent, the sign up process is a delight and the interface shows me how financially turbulent this year might turn out to be if I don’t pull my finger out.</p><h2 id="sasha-bruce-youthwork" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Sasha Bruce Youthwork</h2><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3"><a href="http://sashabruce.org/" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Sasha Bruce Youthwork</a> is a charity based in Washington D.C. that helps homeless and runaway children, and I worked on the front-end for a <a href="http://sashabruce.org/40/" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">new event website</a> which celebrates their 40th anniversary. The project only lasted a couple of days but I’m relatively happy with the results. This was the first time I used the <code class="astro-mMfkrxN3">picture</code> element and seriously pushed back against the need for adding jQuery to a project. Yay for progressive enhancement and performance! Yay for charities making the world a better place!</p><h2 id="css-tricks" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">CSS-Tricks</h2><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">On Sunday I joined the writing staff at CSS-Tricks and I posted two quick updates to the Almanac: the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/" class="astro-mMfkrxN3"><code class="astro-mMfkrxN3">object-fit</code></a> and <a href="http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-position/" class="astro-mMfkrxN3"><code class="astro-mMfkrxN3">object-position</code></a> CSS properties. For now this property isn’t particularly exciting (since the browser support isn’t that great) but look out for them in the future because I guarantee they’ll turn out to be really useful.</p><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">These properties allow us to add background-images or colors to any object (such as a video or an image), which was sort of possible before, although now we have more fine-grain control over that process.</p><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">We can do odd things with these properties, such as make an <a href="http://css-tricks.com/spriting-img/" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">inline-image sprite</a>. Weird, huh?</p><h2 id="codepen" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Codepen</h2><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Speaking of CSS-Tricks, I’m starting to fall in love with <a href="http://codepen.io" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Codepen</a>. For some reason I’ve always thought it was cool but I never really understood why it was more useful than the plethora of alternative tools that let you write code in the browser. However, as I was learning about some JavaScripty things earlier in the week I stumbled upon the greater community of developers, game designers and framework-builders, hundreds and hundreds of people that want to experiment with the underlying technology of front-end development and ultimately want nothing more than to share with you what they know.</p><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Unlike those other services, I’ve already met incredibly smart people and found new ways in which to improve my own work. To put it briefly: I think Codepen is the front-end playground equivalent of Readmill, the defunct reading service which I drooled over at every opportunity whilst it was around because it was a tool that let you discover books and bookish-friends.</p><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Anyway, you can check out <a href="http://codepen.io/robinrendle" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">my profile</a> to see what I might be working on + testing in the future.</p><h2 id="things-that-went-into-my-eyes-and-ears" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Things that went into my eyes and ears</h2><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Usually I can’t listen to podcasts or videos whilst I work, but at one point or another I checked out <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hrishihirway/song-exploder-no-22-the-books" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">The Books on Song Exploder</a> and it was great. Other noteworthy moving-picture-sound-things include:</p><ul class="astro-mMfkrxN3"><li class="astro-mMfkrxN3">A <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/bonus-roderick-on-the-line-live-at-verdi-club-sf.html" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">live recording of Roderick on the Line</a>, of course.</li><li class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Invisibilia’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/377515477/fearless" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">story about fear</a>.</li><li class="astro-mMfkrxN3"><a href="http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Reply-All</a>’s everything.</li><li class="astro-mMfkrxN3">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsDc1YVxHA0" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">speed run of Psychonauts</a> with the original design team.</li></ul><h2 id="books-etc" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Books, etc</h2><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Last night I started reading <em class="astro-mMfkrxN3">You</em> by Austin Grossman and I’m going to write my thoughts up once I finish it but for me this book feels like the spiritual successor to <em class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Close to the Machine</em> (in other words I can’t possibly describe right now how much I’m enjoying this novel at the moment).</p><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">It’s a book about making video games from an actual, honest-to-goodness games designer and it’s a book about technology and storytelling and it captures so much of what I’ve wanted someone to say about the art form.</p><h2 id="where-am-i" class="astro-mMfkrxN3">Where am I?</h2><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">I’m sat on the train heading back to Devon after a couple of days in London where I worked on some freelance projects and I’m buzzing with excitement. It’s late at night and it’s cold outside—the flitter of bulbs that rock by appear to be cast in a formidable bubble of icy darkness—however I’m still recovering from the capital’s ability to blush, ache and sigh whimsically with potential.</p><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">On the train out of Devon the carriages are crowded, yet as you watch the countryside pass you by you’ll get the distinct impression of warming your toes in a bath. Foliage and hills glide past the window as if you were being swept across the country in a hot tub that was attached to a magic carpet, but travelling back towards Plymouth the carriages will spew their insides; these journeys are always dark, they are always cold and they are always very lonely.</p><p class="astro-mMfkrxN3">On the return journey there is a newfound awareness that you happen to be sitting in an uncomfortable seat from a rumbling, belching, wheezing old train that munches itself stupid on coal, and now, to your utter horror, you must listen to the conductor when he half-heartedly claims that this is the train headed to “the Cornish Riviera.”</p></article></div></main></body></html>
