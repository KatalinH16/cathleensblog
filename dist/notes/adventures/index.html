And so now I thought it’s as good a time as any to make a record of why I’m working on this side project, what’s successful about it, what I messed up and what I hope to accomplish in the future.</p><h2 id="audience-who-do-i-want-to-read-it" class="astro-PVcBuGde">Audience: Who do I want to read it?</h2><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">Typically I think design writing is mostly a garbage topic for two reasons: first, it’s a field that encourages writers that are only interested in fame and fortune rather than serious research or good writing. It’s not just a problem with the sort of stuff you find on Medium, but almost everything that makes it to print, too. I often find that writing about design is treading well-worn and familiar ground or is boastful and arrogant instead.</p><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">Second, I think design writing is hot garbage because it encourages <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">boring</em> writing. The technical side of design, the really useful stuff like how fonts actually work, makes for extraordinarily dry reading which happens to be written without any charisma or flair for a group of readers with seemingly infinite patience. And I know that I’m not one of them.</p><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">So with <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">Adventures</em> I wanted to avoid the fame-riddled, Medium-esque writing and the boring stuff I read in books about typography. I want to welcome everyone to the world of typography, from amateurs to professional and experienced type designers. And that’s a tricky sort of balancing act.</p><h2 id="timeline-how-long-should-it-take-to-read" class="astro-PVcBuGde">Timeline: How long should it take to read?</h2><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">The best constraint about the project is that I have to publish an adventure each Saturday evening or Sunday morning. This deadline gives me the incentive and the kick in the butt that I need to continuously write. After long enough it began to feel like exercise, in a good way until now it feels genuinely weird not writing <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">Adventures</em>. However, in the beginning my Saturday mornings were really quite frightful because I’d open up my laptop without a single clue as to what would be good enough.</p><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">Anyway, whenever I think of the ideal <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">Adventures</em> experience I think of someone reading their inbox early on a weekend morning with coffee in hand. The post should take no longer than ten or fifteen minutes to read, even if they happen to follow all the links that I scatter through it. Typically that means I hope to write about one story, or have a single continuous thread, running through it instead of a bunch of links dumped into a list. At the beginning of the project I constantly made the mistake of writing giant essays that tried to accomplish everything and that simply wasn’t scalable, or fun.</p><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">With <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">Adventures in Typography</em> I often think about what Reggie Fils-Aimé said about the design of Mario: <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">if it isn’t fun, then why bother?</em></p><h2 id="voice-what-should-it-sound-like" class="astro-PVcBuGde">Voice: What should it sound like?</h2><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">I experimented with the tone for the longest time. At first I expected it to be serious and rather stately, but I found that it’s far too difficult to write something <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">serious</em> in the timeframe that I give myself. Plus, I know that if it was a Sunday morning I wouldn’t rush to my inbox to find a giant essay about type sitting there. But if there was a lighthearted story with a bunch of links to surf through then heck yes I most certainly would.</p><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">This leads to my second set of rules for <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">Adventures</em>: keep it jovial, lighthearted and brief. It took me yonks to learn that my voice in <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">Adventures</em> should sound just like I speak in real life; fast-paced, optimistic-as-all-heck and full of bumbling errors.</p><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">I then found myself enjoying the posts that were more like a stream of consciousness or an open notepad of all the messy thoughts bumping around in my head. With that, I began to take myself less seriously, and be less critical when it comes to the editing process. <em class="astro-PVcBuGde">It’s okay if the posts have spelling mistakes and it’s okay if they don’t quite lead anywhere.</em> This isn’t homework. It’s a clunky, excitable email sent to a close friend.</p><p class="astro-PVcBuGde">My general goal is this: if a single intelligible and kind word can be wrenched out of me as I write that particular week’s letter than that’s a fine adventure for me. And I hope it is for you, as well.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
