It’s a sci-fi novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky and the book’s premise is a wonderful if not entirely ghoulish one: aliens land on Earth but leave without contacting us. In their wake they leave polluted landscapes that the government calls Zones which have been locked off for only a small batch of scientists to explore. But there’s another group called the stalkers that sneak in and steal bits of alien junk and sell it for a fortune.</p><p class="astro-bGe9FCjp">The landscape and the objects that they’ve left behind in the Zones are peculiar though. They’re indescribably dangerous.</p><p class="astro-bGe9FCjp">If you loved Jeff VanderMeer’s novels <em class="astro-bGe9FCjp">Area X</em> or <em class="astro-bGe9FCjp">Borne</em>, or if you liked the <em class="astro-bGe9FCjp">Annihilation</em> movie with Natalie Portman, then it’s obvious from the very first page of this book that those things were entirely inspired by <em class="astro-bGe9FCjp">Roadside Picnic</em>.</p><p class="astro-bGe9FCjp">This novel was also the inspiration for the 1979 film <em class="astro-bGe9FCjp">Stalker</em> though, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and it was notorious for its hazardous working conditions – they shot the whole film in two days downstream from a nearby chemical plant. And the crazy thing about this is film is how it shows how aliens broke our world but the film is a real recording of environmental devastation in Estonia: it was snowing in summer and poisonous white foam floated down the river during filming which was likely the cause of death for several crew members, including Tarkovsky himself.</p><p class="astro-bGe9FCjp">Anyway, the reason why I bring this up is because although I haven’t seen the film I have one shot of it imprinted in my mind. I’ve seen this picture so many times that the movie has taken on this mythical, romantic vision in my head. It’s a photograph of a man standing in a warehouse where the cement floor has bubbled and distorted all around him:</p><p class="astro-bGe9FCjp"><img src="/images/stalker.jpg" alt="stalker.jpg" class="astro-bGe9FCjp"></p><p class="astro-bGe9FCjp">I think this image perfectly describes the weirdness of <em class="astro-bGe9FCjp">Roadside Picnic</em> where familiar things are broken or mutated in frightening ways. Next up after this is the <em class="astro-bGe9FCjp">Dead Mountaineer’s Hotel</em> which I’ve also heard wonderful things about.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
