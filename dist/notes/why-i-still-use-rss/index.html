I found my answer in RSS. I enjoyed the freedom to see sources as I wanted, the flexibility to move to a new reader if I wanted, the complete lack of advertising. It was hard to not fall in love with the service.</p><p class="astro-OK0bfUjD">However it wasn't until I began working from home and everything in my life moved online that I really began to notice how beneficial RSS could be with relation to Digital Wellbeing. By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators etc. that I had a serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life.</p></blockquote><p class="astro-OK0bfUjD">On a completely separate tangent here: Marc doesn't share his last name or anything and whenever I see that on the web I'm always impressed. There's an alt-timeline Robin who never shared his name on the web and writes outrageous things about the thoughts in his head via a cool pseudonym like <code class="astro-OK0bfUjD">Infinite Mess</code> or something I don’t know I haven’t had coffee yet.</p><p class="astro-OK0bfUjD">Anyway, this reminds me of two things.</p><p class="astro-OK0bfUjD">First: a while back I tried to learn more about <a href="https://www.kickscondor.com/" class="astro-OK0bfUjD">Kicks Condor</a> and couldn't find anything about whoever makes that site. And it feels so punk rock to me, not having to be known and putting a distance between you and the reader. It feels so very 20th-century-novelist to me.</p><p class="astro-OK0bfUjD">And some writers are extremely good at that Sexy Mystery Distance but I think I’m always going to be the opposite end of that spectrum. Blogging is the opposite of all that mystery, in a way.</p><p class="astro-OK0bfUjD">Second: this reminds me of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/im-not-black-im-kanye/559763/" class="astro-OK0bfUjD">Coates’s piece about Kanye and Michael Jackson</a>:</p><blockquote class="astro-OK0bfUjD"><p class="astro-OK0bfUjD">...[Kanye] is a god, though one born of a different time and a different need. Jackson rose in the last days of enigma and wonder; West, in an accessible age, when every fuck is a tweet and every defecation a status update. And perhaps, in that way, West has done something more remarkable, more amazing than Jackson, because he is a man of no mystery, overexposed, who holds the world’s attention through simply the consistent, amazing, near-peerless quality of his work.</p></blockquote></article></div></main></body></html>
