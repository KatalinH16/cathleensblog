I love its New-Yorker-I-am-wearing-a-bowler-hat-and-having-a-great-time sort of vibe. I like the difference in height between the capital letters and the x-height, its almost-Chaparral look. Okay, okay. I’ll admit it; I love it all.</p><p class="astro-cQ8o5K5P"><img src="/images/alum-2.png" alt="Another specimen of Aluminia" class="astro-cQ8o5K5P"></p><p class="astro-cQ8o5K5P">The type family—Roman, italic, small caps, and oblique—is based on the 1930s metal type family Electra, designed by W.A.Dwiggins. And there’s <a href="https://letterformarchive.org/news/recasting-aluminia" class="astro-cQ8o5K5P">a great interview</a> with the designer Jim Parkinson about how he interpreted those old designs. But! The Letterform Archive folks also took a bit from Dwiggins’s specimen of Electra in the 1930s where the designer is asking someone what the new century of type design will feel like:</p><blockquote class="astro-cQ8o5K5P"><p class="astro-cQ8o5K5P">“Electricity” he said, “sparks, energy — high-speed steel — metal shavings coming off a lathe — precise, positive — say it with a snap.” I waited to see if he would get closer to something that I could use. “Take your curves and stream-line ’em. Make a line of letters so full of energy that it can’t wait to get to the end of the measure. My God — these Lino machines that you tell me about — what kind of letters would they spit out if you left it to them? 1500 Venetian? Not!”</p></blockquote><p class="astro-cQ8o5K5P">Anyway, I got so excited about this that I switched out the body text here with Aluminia, too. Does it pair well with Ayer as the headline? <em class="astro-cQ8o5K5P">Mmmmmm...</em> maybe not so much. But I sort of like how everything is extremely wonky right now. I think if I paired Aluminia with something less weird than Ayer than it could push the scales too far in the direction of the New Yorker and make my writing feel a bit pompous perhaps? Yeah.</p><p class="astro-cQ8o5K5P">Although...the flash of text is now somewhat worse, and it was pretty bad before this change. I’ll fix that at a later point as I probably have to rethink my whole font loading strategy.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
