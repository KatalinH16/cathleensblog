In that post, Jules excitedly quotes the episode with Hank Green where he says:</p><blockquote class="astro-HSDgz4iX"><p class="astro-HSDgz4iX">[...] there are all these phenomena in human life that are really resistant to language. I think physical pain is the one that’s perhaps most dramatically resistant to language.</p><p class="astro-HSDgz4iX">But, for me, there’s also something about taste that’s resistant to language and one of the reasons we fight, I think, about Hawaiian pizza is because we almost cannot describe to each other how it tastes to us.</p></blockquote><p class="astro-HSDgz4iX">There are so many things that are resistant to language! And a couple of weeks ago I was in hospital, I had contracted appendicitis, and whilst I was in the ER I was asked how much pain I was in and <em class="astro-HSDgz4iX">wow</em>. I found that I have no idea how to put my experience on a chart! My pain is...a...6 maybe? Is that too much? Is my 6 someone else’s 4?</p><p class="astro-HSDgz4iX">This had me thinking about how design systems is resistant to data in a similar way; it’s almost impossible to measure the success or failure of a design system. It’s impossible to say that having seven modal components instead of one is a good idea and it’s impossible to say what effect four different illustration styles is having on your design and engineering team.</p><p class="astro-HSDgz4iX">How much does your team need a UI Kit? Is that a 6 or a 7?</p><p class="astro-HSDgz4iX">I reckon all efforts to measure the success of a design system will come up short and are more likely do <a href="/notes/against-metrics-how-measuring-performance-by-numbers-backfires" class="astro-HSDgz4iX">harm by measuring them</a>. There is no-one that can tell you how bad things are, you just have to be close enough to the code and close enough to the design to feel things out.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
