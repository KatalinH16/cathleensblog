There’s really been nothing quite like it, before or since, but the job got done. In fact, it got done so well, barely anything adverse happened and some misguided people now think it was all a hoax designed to extract hefty consulting fees, instead of the successful global preventative effort it actually was.</p><p class="astro-eBOl8Hz7">As for us, pretty much everything on the Web side was fine. And then, in the middle of one of our staff meetings about Y2K certification, John Sully said something to the effect of, “Wouldn’t it be funny if the Web server suddenly thought it was 1900 and you had to use a telegraph to connect to it?”</p><p class="astro-eBOl8Hz7">We all laughed and riffed on the concept for a bit and then went back to Serious Work Topics, but the idea stuck in my head. What would a 1900-era Web site look like?</p></blockquote><p class="astro-eBOl8Hz7">On the 1st of January 2000, Eric’s alternate universe website had the warning:</p><blockquote class="astro-eBOl8Hz7"><p class="astro-eBOl8Hz7">Despite our best efforts at averting Y2K problems, it seems that our Web server now believes that it is January of 1900. Please be advised that we are working diligently on the problem and hope to have it fixed soon.</p></blockquote></article></div></main></body></html>
