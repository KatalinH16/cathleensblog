Instead, we should get to work improving this button, fixing this infrastructure policy, or tackling this gnarly accessibility issue with our links.</p><p class="astro-6T68aD7f">I see this problem everywhere in the community; dudes seem to think that design is a problem of taste rather than a problem of diligent, patient work built up over many years. There’s a large contingent of designers that believe the hard work of design systems is walking into a room and telling everyone they need more drop shadows.</p><p class="astro-6T68aD7f">Fuck your drop shadows.</p><p class="astro-6T68aD7f">Likewise I’m bored of how many folks treat design systems as this super cool and sexy work that didn’t exist a couple of years ago. An example? Yesterday I spent all day searching through a million lines of code to find how many instances of the class name “checkbox” exists. I’ve been doing “design systems” work since I was 18 and so many other front-end oriented folks have done likewise.</p><p class="astro-6T68aD7f">Because the only way to build a great website is with a system –&nbsp;we just didn’t call it that back in the day. We called it front-end architecture.</p><p class="astro-6T68aD7f">Anyway, I am an old man and my point is that design systems work is painfully, awfully, beautifully boring. There aren’t any sexy projects after you’ve picked the border-radius of your buttons. Each project after that will feel like an enormous hurdle because that’s the nature of the job.</p><p class="astro-6T68aD7f">I’m not saying this to dunk on the field – I love my career whole heartedly – but design systems requires a love of all those unsexy things. And I want to ensure that folks aren’t turned away by all the dudes with nice hair that talk about their goddamn drop shadows.</p><p class="astro-6T68aD7f">To all the people that love making spreadsheets and organizing their cupboards: you are sorely missed.</p><p class="astro-6T68aD7f">And we need you.</p></article></div></main></body></html>
