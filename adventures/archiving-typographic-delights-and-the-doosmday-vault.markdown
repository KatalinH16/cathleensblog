<p>This week my thoughts have been revolving around the topic of preservation and archiving thanks to an article by Rebecca Capua, a print conservation expert at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She wrote about <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2016/new-life-for-book-of-the-dead">the long journey to renovate the Ptolemaic galleries of Egyptian Art</a> and she goes on to describe her work in restoring <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551786">the Book of the Dead of the Priest of Horus</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the name, the Book of the Dead is not a single object, as the wealthy at the time would often make a contract for their own copy to be made with handpicked spells and incantations to be drawn on a roll of papyrus. The spells&nbsp;were an attempt to preserve their spirit in the afterlife&nbsp;but, as complicated as it might be preserve a spirit after death, preserving the Book of the Dead is excruciatingly difficult work as well: there’s no fanfare or celebration once the work has been completed, simply because the work itself will never end.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Speaking of preservation, many years ago back when I studied at the Department of Typography and Graphic Communication at Reading University, I visited a weekly lecture by Michael Twyman called <em>Typographic Delights.</em> Each week Michael would fill a room with ephemera: one week it would be posters, the next it would be children’s books or newspapers, the week after that it would be colorful objects printed via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography">Lithography</a>. Many of the pieces that Michael displayed were hundreds of years old yet he encouraged us to pick up the objects;&nbsp;to turn them over in our hands;&nbsp;to let them live once more, if only briefly.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="942301" height="480" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/16a225b4-a708-404a-829b-568b56bc88d9.jpg" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640" /><br/>
The question that haunted me was this:&nbsp;where did Michael store all of these things?&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
I imagined a vast archive,&nbsp;like a vault or a bank, hidden out in the campus grounds.&nbsp;At dusk, Michael would cover his tracks in the dirt as he ventured to collect the materials before the next seminar. I imagined he&nbsp;would double back, once, twice, three times,&nbsp;in order to preserve the location of his treasure. Hungry thieves or bandits would wait for him in the middle of the night&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;plunder his <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/robinrendle/albums/72157628226996591/with/8026644078/">invaluable collection</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When I finally mustered up the courage to ask Michael where this collection was kept safe, he looked up from behind a book that was almost the full size of his own body: “Why I keep them all at home, of course!”&nbsp;he replied with a mischievous&nbsp;smile.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="942333" height="476" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/771326e3-0694-4644-b11d-d3a08bf6062b.jpg" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"/></p>

<p>Consequently all of this reminds me of my favourite book at the moment:&nbsp;<em>The Triumph of Seeds. </em>This book doesn’t have&nbsp;anything to do with books or typography, in fact it’s&nbsp;a book about plant-life and our relationship to our environment. But in this wonderful piece of non-fiction&nbsp;the author Thor Hansen writes about a very similar kind of preservation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, scientists unveiled a new international seed repository in the Norwegian Arctic. Carved deep into a mountainside in the Svalbard archipelago, it preserves seeds in cold, dry darkness with little need for additional refrigeration or other support from above…Dubbed the “Doomsday Vault,” its opening made headlines around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here’s the important part that relates to the Book of the Dead and Michael Twyman’s collection of books:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The attention raised the profile of their work and provided a needed boost in the constant struggle for funding. And running a seed bank is anything but cheap. While words like “vault” and “bank” imply simply turning the key and walking away, managing a seed collection requires constant activity. Even in cold storage, the samples steadily degrade and must be checked continuously to make sure they’re still viable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So: archival work isn’t like the ending of the Raiders of the Lost Ark then, since cataloguing an item and throwing it into storage is only the first part of a much greater body of work. The next step requires careful stewardship and an almost&nbsp;superhuman ability to think far, far into the future.<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="942369" height="308" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/43378925-dfc8-443f-ac05-62fb309e3c02.gif" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640" /><span style="font-size: 0.83em;">Pictured above: Michael Twyman’s home of typographic curiosities</span></p>

<p>Hence, these are the questions that are tumbling around in my head right now: How do we keep typographic materials, like those found at Michael Twyman’s house or in the Letterform Archive,&nbsp;safe for&nbsp;future generations? Who should pay for all this laborious work? And, how do we archive this material so that anyone can access this material&nbsp;from anywhere?</p>

<h2>The Week in Type</h2>

<p>First things first: I made a goof last week when I said that Netflix’s new show Stranger Things was set in Hobeaux. Thankfully, Miguel Sanz has written <a href="http://fontsinuse.com/uses/13992/stranger-things">an excellent piece</a> on Fonts In Use that digs into the show’s use of ITC Benguiat and ITC Avant Garde Gothic:<br/>
<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="942393" height="340" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/17a23ec3-8f46-4530-9084-386f7e7d97f2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640" /><br/>
Further in Miguel’s post, Stephen Coles added a comment with an advertisement of ITC Benguiat and argued that the typeface <em>encouraged</em> this sort of awkward interlocking arrangement of letters, as seen with the N and G’s above.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Anyway, it’s important to remember that&nbsp;the trick to reading a post on Fonts In Use is to <em>always read the comments</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>¶¶¶</p>

<p>Bruce Kennett, author of <a href="http://letterformarchive.org/dwiggins/">the upcoming book on W.A.Dwiggins</a>, replied to the last <em>Adventures</em>&nbsp;to mention a wonderful story about Samuel Clemens, a.k.a Mark Twain, and his typewriter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clemens was the very first author to submit the complete manuscript of a book in typewritten form. The manuscript arrived at Harpers without any punctuation. (I suppose it may have been a tedious procedure for Clemens to add punctuation on his machine, so he left it off. Although I’m interested to see that it is present in the 1874 letter he wrote to his brother …) In any case, the manuscript arrived without any, so the editorial department sent back a respectful note asking Clemens to mail them a new copy of the manuscript with punctuation in the correct places. In response, Clemens cranked a dozen sheets of paper into the typewriter, pounded out hundreds of commas, periods, semicolons, etc. and mailed the packet back to Harpers with the note, “Here’s the punctuation. Put it in wherever you like.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kennett mentioned that this was from Justin Kaplan’s 1966 biography <em>Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain</em> which I haven’t double checked but I adore the story either way.</p>

<p>Over on the Typekit blog, <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2016/07/28/changes-to-web-font-serving-on-typekit/">Bram Stein announced</a> changes to the way in which Typekit now serves webfonts across its network. This update improves performance in lots of neat ways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before making this change, we set up a new performance monitoring system that sends performance metrics back to us at random intervals. This allowed us to monitor font loading metrics before and after the change.</p>

<p>Our performance metrics show that the new approach results in much faster load times for fonts — as much as 300 milliseconds faster compared with the old method.</p>

<p>¶¶¶</p>

<p>Earlier in the week <a href="https://twitter.com/johndjameson/status/757668536424796160">John Jameson</a> linked to <a href="http://usabilitypost.com/2012/11/05/stop-fixing-font-smoothing/">an excellent post by Dmitry Fadeyev</a> on the <code>webkit-font-smoothing</code> CSS property:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The antialiasing mode is not a “fix” for subpixel rendering — in most cases it’s a handicap. Subpixel rendering is technically superior, clearer, and more readable than antialiasing because by utilizing every one of the subpixels it increases its effective resolution used for font smoothing by three times. Antialiasing is useful for certain circumstances, such as for light on dark text, but it is absolutely not a replacement for subpixel rendering, and certainly not a “fix”.</p>

<p>I clicked the wrong link on the Commercial Type website earlier this week and stumbled upon the <a href="http://showcase.commercialtype.com">Showcase section</a> which I had never seen before and obviously it’s&nbsp;beautiful:<br/>
<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="942425" height="411" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/83e9963c-e1e6-4b4e-99ae-638abd03fc08.png" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"/></p>

<p>From the description about the microsite:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since we started licensing our fonts for use on the web, we’ve been thinking more and more about the aesthetic possibilities for typography on the web that come with a dynamic and interactive canvas. This showcase came about because we wanted to explore how typefaces with more assertive personalities, like Druk and Gabriello, could be used on the web, as well as how utilitarian workhorses, like Publico and Lyon, work as well on screen as they do in print.</p>

<p>¶¶¶</p>

<p>Did you know that Cuba has two entirely separate currencies? <a href="http://www.alphabettes.org/my-2cents-cubas-2-currencies/">Sara Soskolne wrote about them</a> for the always brilliant Alphabettes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most importantly though, this visual difference between the two notes reflects a profound difference in how they function. As a result of these two parallel currencies, Cuba also essentially now has two parallel economies: one for Cubans whose work is part of the 75% state-run economy, and another for those whose work serves the tourism industry or foreign trade.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post continues the series about currency called <em>My 2¢</em>, where designers are asked to write a quick and interesting post about money. Many interesting questions pop up in this collection of articles: How can we <a href="http://www.alphabettes.org/my-2cents-shelley-1-2-rupee/">solve literacy problems with coins</a>? What control does a type designer have over <a href="http://www.alphabettes.org/my-2cents-two-typefaces-vanished/">the final product</a>? And how can a humble coin act as <a href="http://www.alphabettes.org/my-2cents-canadian-1-coin/">a token of a political movement</a>?</p>

<p>If you’re looking for tools to help you work with type then <a href="http://typography.supply/">typography.supply</a> has your back. Designed by Tim Brown and Andrew Johnson, this helpful site collects links to applications and websites&nbsp;made for both type designers and typographers and in mind.</p>

<p>When I was working on <a href="https://robinrendle.com/essays/new-web-typography/">The New Web Typography</a> I recognised that my SVG skills were simply not up to scratch. What should have taken me several minutes to figure out instead took many hours to hack together.</p>

<p>That’s why I very much wish that&nbsp;<a href="https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg">Practical SVG</a>, written by your friendly neighbourhood hero Chris Coyier, was available at the time. I had so many questions! What’s the best way to optimize SVGs? Which tools are out there? What’s the best approach to animate them? This information was&nbsp;out there but it wasn’t in a single repository, a complete resource, which I could keep by my side at all times.</p>

<p>But now that imaginary companion is mercifully available in the real world to anyone that might want to build their own vector-based wonder for themselves.</p>

<h2>Letter of the Week</h2>

<p>My favourite character this week is this capital “R” by Toshi Omagari. <a href="https://twitter.com/arabictype">Nadine Chahine</a>, herself an incredible type designer, interviewed Toshi after an event held by designers at Monotype in 2015 called <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2015/08/25/font-marathon/">Font Marathon</a>. During this event the team hoped to design two new typefaces in just a few days.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="942441" height="480" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/8e70e735-c54e-49ee-b80a-5e4e89fc870c.png" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"/><br/>
Toshi called this prototype typeface Cowhand, and I don’t think it’s been&nbsp;released yet, but I can’t stop staring at the regular widths and daydreaming about how I might use it for the future.<br/>
<br/>
