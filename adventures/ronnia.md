There’s something about Ronnia that I completely adore. It’s a sans type family by [TypeTogether](https://www.type-together.com/) released in 2007 and it’s one of those times where I’ve stumbled upon something and then it’s sat patiently in an open tab for a couple of weeks. I find myself opening [the specimen website](https://www.type-together.com/ronnia-font) every couple of hours and just staring at it, longingly, and I’m not entirely certain why.

There’s often no rhyme or reason as to why or when I fall in love, but that’s often the case when it comes to beautiful letters. And especially with Ronnia.

I think the numerals show why I’m so infatuated: there’s a degree of subtlety in their design. There’s just enough quirkiness to make them stand out without being whacky or clownish and one example of that is the 7 and 8:

See what I mean? For whatever reason though I think I’m more fond of the condensed form of Ronnia. It looks as if the folks at TypeTogether had so much fun drawing it. Just look at the capital C! Or the capital S! The lowercase a and Ç! Also yes I’ve had far too much coffee today and should probably calm down.
